7ed599059a04fad250fcfb37442e21b6,"For Trump, a ‘national emergency’ is anything he says it is — including the migrant caravan","      By  David Nakamura          David Nakamura Reporter covering the White House  Email  Bio  Follow         October 31 at 6:34 PM  President Trump declared a national emergency last week — in a tweet. Aiming his ire at a caravan of migrant families hundreds of miles from the United States, Trump vowed he was “bringing out the military for a National Emergency.” His administration then authorized sending more than 5,000 active-duty troops to the border. But Trump has filed no legal proclamation declaring a national crisis as required under a 1976 law enacted to rein in abuses of executive power by granting presidents additional authorities only in specific instances and for a limited time frame. For Trump, the caravan is an emergency merely because he said so. Critics said the president’s approach represents another measure of his willingness to act outside the bounds of his predecessors — in this case using an official term to portray migrants as dangerous and to stoke public fears ahead of next week’s midterm elections. They warned that Trump is priming supporters to place their faith solely in his judgment over what warrants an emergency response from the executive branch. Their fears grew more acute this month when the Federal Emergency Management Agency tested a new presidential alert system, which allows the White House to issue notifications to every cellphone in the nation.         window.havePowaBoot=true;  Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the 1976 National Emergencies Act was intended to offer the public a clear White House rationale for pursuing emergency actions — a safeguard that Trump has circumvented with his impetuous nature and loose language. The law “is in some ways built on the assumption a president will use it appropriately when there is an emergency,” Ornstein said. “We have to challenge all our assumptions right now. I find it chilling.” Trump’s predecessors often invoked the 1976 law when facing down crises they believed threatened the nation. President George W. Bush, for instance, declared a national emergency on Sept. 14, 2001, in the wake of terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Alerting Congress through a formal proclamation, Bush moved to gain additional legal powers over the U.S. military. Nine days later, he declared a second emergency — to pursue economic sanctions on terrorist groups. Since running a campaign focused heavily on threats from abroad — including immigration, terrorism and predatory trade — Trump has sought to consolidate support from his base through a governing strategy that asserts national security concerns in all manner of foreign and domestic affairs. In doing so, he has aimed to use fear to advance his domestic agenda and build support for unilateral actions.        if(typeof window.powaBoot===""function"")window.powaBoot();else{window.powaBootBoot=window.powaBootBoot||function(){if(null===document.querySelector('script[src*\x3d""powaBoot.js""]')){var script=document.createElement(""script"");var scripts=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];script.src=""https://d1pz6dax0t5mop.cloudfront.net/prod/powaBoot.js?_\x3d20180521B"";script.async=true;scripts.parentNode.insertBefore(script,scripts);window.havePowaBoot=true}};window.powaBootBoot()};  Without consulting Congress, Trump’s administration has implemented a travel ban on residents of several majority-Muslim countries, slapped huge trade tariffs on China, stripped security clearances from former high-ranking U.S. officials who were critical of Trump, and separated immigrant children from their families at the border. Trump and his aides said the president is now weighing new executive orders intended to strip asylum protections from Central Americans in the caravan and end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants. Critics have pointed to the mass shooting that killed 11 Jewish congregants last weekend at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh as a potential consequence of the president’s fearmongering. The suspect in the shooting, Robert Bowers, 46, of Baldwin, Pa., disliked Trump but was said to believe the migrant caravan was a Jewish conspiracy. Some of Trump’s Republican allies, along with Fox News commentators, have fanned unsubstantiated allegations that George Soros, a wealthy Democratic donor who is Jewish, funded the caravan. “Trump uses a lot of talk that’s not of a technical or legal manner,” said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. “He could declare a national emergency to free up a number of statutory authorities, but it’s not clear what kind of authorities he wants to use here. More likely, it’s a rhetorical play to show how furious he is about this group of vulnerable migrants.” The law governing presidential emergency powers was enacted in response to concerns over actions by President Richard M. Nixon, who declared two national emergencies within 17 months. In 1970, he called up the National Guard to help deliver mail during an eight-day postal strike; a year later, he implemented price controls on consumer goods for 90 days, delivering a temporary jolt to the economy in the run-up to the 1972 presidential election. The new law required presidents to offer a legal rationale for the emergency powers they were seeking. Those powers would lapse within a year if they were not renewed, and Congress would have the authority to invalidate them. But the law has not been as effective as intended, experts said. Presidents in successive administrations have repeatedly renewed emergency declarations since President Jimmy Carter issued the first one during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979. That emergency proclamation — allowing the U.S. to block Iranian government properties — remains in effect, along with 29 others issued by the presidents since Carter. Bill Clinton declared emergencies 17 times, George W. Bush 12 and Barack Obama 13. The law has been invoked most to enact economic sanctions on foreign entities, including North Korea and the Taliban, but the emergencies also have been used during an influenza outbreak in 2009 and to combat cyberattacks in 2015. Presidents also have the power to mobilize emergency federal resources on a more regional level through the Stafford Act, which is typically used during hurricanes. Trump has issued two new proclamations under the National Emergencies Act — in December 2017, to issue economic sanctions against human rights abusers abroad, and in September, to penalize foreign entities that attempt to interfere in U.S. elections. Kim Lane Scheppele, a Princeton University international affairs professor, said Trump’s rhetoric, while intemperate, would be more dangerous if he “had better lawyers” who were capable of translating his Twitter threats into legal rationales to tap into more emergency powers. “A lot of what Trump is doing is barking more than biting,” said Scheppele, who specializes in constitutional and international law. “He’s using the language, but it’s not tied to any legal thing.” But Jeh Johnson, who was homeland security secretary in Obama’s second term, said Trump is “reaching for exercises in presidential authority” in search of a quick fix to the complicated problem of immigration flows. Johnson recalled the public concern over an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Africa in 2014. The Obama administration considered invoking emergency authority to ban all travelers from Africa, he said, but settled on funneling air traffic from West Africa to five U.S. airports staffed with medical personnel to screen passengers. “We recognized there is no legal lever you can pull to close a 1,900-mile border,” Johnson said. Of Trump, he added that the president “looks at the caravan heading north as a direct challenge to his presidential authority to secure our borders. He wants to send a deterrent message to the migrants heading north, and he wants to show the voters before the midterms that he is sending it.” ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-trump-a-national-emergency-is-anything-he-says-it-is--including-the-migrant-caravan/2018/10/31/6954bbf4-dd1a-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html,washingtonpost,www.washingtonpost.com,1108,13

I’m sick and tired of what’s going on. I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired, and I hope you are, too.”  — Joe Biden  I’m sick and tired, too. I’m sick and tired of a president who pretends that a caravan of impoverished refugees is an “invasion” by “unknown Middle Easterners” and “bad thugs” — and whose followers on Fox News pretend the refugees are bringing leprosy and smallpox to the United States. (Smallpox was eliminated about 40 years ago.) I’m sick and tired of a president who misuses his office to demagogue on immigration — by unnecessarily sending 5,200 troops to the border and by threatening to rescind by executive order the 14th Amendment guarantee of citizenship to anyone born in the United States. I’m sick and tired of a president who is so self-absorbed that he thinks he is the real victim of mail-bomb attacks on his political opponents — and who, after visiting Pittsburgh despite being asked by local leaders to stay away, tweeted about how he was treated, not about the victims of the synagogue massacre.    President Trump at a campaign rally on Oct. 4 in Rochester, Minn. (Evan Vucci/AP)  I’m sick and tired of a president who cheers a congressman for his physical assault of a reporter, calls the press the “enemy of the people ” and won’t stop or apologize even after bombs were sent to CNN in the mail. I’m sick and tired of a president who employs the language of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Jewish financier George Soros and “globalists,” and won’t apologize or retract even after what is believed to be the worst attack on Jews in U.S. history. I’m sick and tired of a president who won’t stop engaging in crazed partisanship, denouncing Democrats as “evil,” “un-American” and “treasonous” subversives who are in league with criminals. I’m sick and tired of a president who cares so little about right-wing terrorism that, on the very day of the synagogue shooting, he proceeded with a campaign rally, telling his supporters, “Let’s have a good time.” I’m sick and tired of a president who presides over one of the most unethical administrations in U.S. history — with three Cabinet members resigning for reported ethical infractions and the secretary of the interior the subject of at least 18 federal investigations. I’m sick and tired of a president who flouts norms of accountability by refusing to release his tax returns or place his business holdings in a blind trust. I’m sick and tired of a president who lies outrageously and incessantly — an average of eight times a day — claiming recently that there are riots in California and that a bill that passed the Senate 98 to 1 had “very little Democrat support.” I’m sick and tired of a president who can’t be bothered to work hard and instead prefers to spend his time watching Fox News and acting like a Twitter troll. And I’m sick and tired of Republicans who go along with Trump — defending, abetting and imitating his egregious excesses. I’m sick and tired of Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) acting like a caddie for the man he once denounced as a “kook” — just this week, Graham endorsed Trump’s call for rescinding “birthright citizenship,” a kooky idea if ever there was one. I’m sick and tired of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who got his start in politics as a protege of the “bleeding-heart conservative” Jack Kemp, refusing to call out Trump’s race-baiting. I’m sick and tired of Republicans who once complained about the federal debt adding $113 billion to the debt just in fiscal year 2018. I’m sick and tired of Republicans who once championed free trade refusing to stop Trump as he launches trade wars with all of our major trade partners. I’m sick and tired of Republicans who not only refuse to investigate Trump’s alleged ethical violations but who also help him to obstruct justice by maligning the FBI, the special counsel and the Justice Department. Most of all, I’m sick and tired of Republicans who feel that Trump’s blatant bigotry gives them license to do the same — with Rep. Pete Olson (R-Tex.) denouncing his opponent as an “Indo-American carpetbagger,” Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis warning voters not to “monkey this up” by electing his African American opponent, Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.) labeling his “Palestinian Mexican” opponent a “security risk” who is “working to infiltrate Congress,” and Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) accusing his opponent, who is of Indian Tibetan heritage, of “selling out Americans” because he once worked at a law firm that settled terrorism-related cases against Libya. If you’re sick and tired, too, here is what you can do. Vote for Democrats on Tuesday. For every office. Regardless of who they are. And I say that as a former Republican. Some Republicans in suburban districts may claim they aren’t for Trump. Don’t believe them. Whatever their private qualms, no Republicans have consistently held Trump to account. They are too scared that doing so will hurt their chances of reelection. If you’re as sick and tired as I am of being sick and tired about what’s going on, vote against all Republicans.

0daebe2500fe80e189b029db6c7367de,Maryland rights a wrong — but it remains a long way from being out of the woods,"          By  Barry Svrluga          Barry Svrluga Sports columnist with beat writing experience on baseball, golf, the NFL, college basketball and college football  Email  Bio  Follow         Sports columnist  October 31 at 10:53 PM    Finally, someone with the most basic combination of sanity, decency and clearheadedness surfaced Wednesday evening at the University of Maryland. Let’s not overstate the praise of Wallace D. Loh, president of the flagship College Park campus, because his fingers are all over this mess that has stained the school. But in a dizzying 24 hours in which rudimentary logic and the base-level well-being of the student body had been cast aside, at least Loh stepped forward and did what any rational leader would have done long ago: fire football coach DJ Durkin. That Loh spit in the face of his misguided board of regents — which unfathomably reinstated Durkin on Tuesday — isn’t insignificant, because that very board had essentially strong-armed the College Park president and still has the ability to dismiss him. Only a day earlier, that very board essentially made a condition of Loh’s employment that Durkin return, which was some combination of unconscionable and reckless. Chaos, though, can occasionally result in clarity. In this case, for those who care about the University of Maryland: Thank God. Durkin is gone. Exhale and collect yourselves. All is not well. But at least now there is some sort of path forward. [DJ Durkin, Maryland part ways following outcry over coach’s reinstatement] For sure, it’s murky, littered with fallen limbs and treacherous crevices — not to mention Michigan and Ohio State and Penn State on the schedule every year. But a skilled and forceful leader might be able to navigate it — or at least give it a noble shot — if such a scarred school is capable of luring a skilled and forceful leader anymore. There would not have been any such path had Durkin remained; that much was clear. The stench that resulted from the death of Jordan McNair would have followed him everywhere. It will stick to him now, as he heads out of town, even if Maryland has to pay him the $5.8 million remaining on his contract. He is damaged by this situation, a permanent mark against him. Someone will employ him at some point, and that someone will have to look at himself in the mirror and wonder whether Durkin’s ability to scheme a defensive front is worth the deal with the devil it will take to make the hire. Given that this is college sports, we know he will get a job. There is no longer a bottom here, even when you think it can’t get worse. But forget Durkin now, as hard as that may be. He’s gone. That’s important. But in preparing to move on — and this is sure to be a long, painful process — it’s also important to remember how Maryland got here. [Maryland football players react to DJ Durkin’s departure: ‘Pressure busts pipes doesn’t it??’] Maryland is here, of course, because McNair died. The 19-year-old offensive lineman died on Durkin’s watch, died in the environment Durkin created. It’s a small blessing that McNair’s former teammates don’t have to answer questions now about what Durkin’s program is like since his return, about how the coach has changed. That would have been nauseating. It’s a mighty blessing that Durkin won’t stand before us and tell us how he will right his past wrongs. He didn’t deserve the chance, not for a year or a week or a day. But Maryland is here, too, not solely because Durkin was hired and McNair died. Maryland is here because it long ago lost its way. It lost its way badly. You can’t draw a line directly from Jordan McNair’s death to Maryland’s decision to leave the ACC for the Big Ten. But they’re not wholly unrelated either. Both are relevant in discussing Maryland’s identity, athletically and otherwise. They matter in considering the conditions at the May workout during which McNair collapsed. And they matter in considering how to move beyond it all. Work with me here. Considering Maryland is about to open its 100th season of men’s basketball, it’s not terribly long ago that the Terrapins were clearly defined, at least in sports. That identity: Gary Williams walking onto the court in a spotlight, thrusting his fist to the crowd, a hitch in his step and a scowl on his face. God love him, he was Maryland at its underdog and renegade best. That identity: Ralph Friedgen, gathered with his team in a corner of Byrd Stadium, belting out the Maryland “Victory Song” in concert with the student section — a student section that, back then, actually showed up and actually cared. [Maryland players involved in altercation amid turmoil in College Park] Those two alums, they didn’t get always get along. But they understood the school. They understood the programs. They understood the limitations but more importantly the possibilities. And they flourished. Maryland was a national champion in basketball and an Orange Bowl participant in football, with three straight 10-win seasons. That was only a decade-and-a-half ago. Scarcely seems possible now. Loh, along with former athletic director Kevin Anderson, pushed Maryland away from that solid, steady base by yanking the school from the ACC to the Big Ten. This was a money grab, nothing short of it, a move that shoved to the side generations of tradition and history because Jim Delany, the Big Ten commissioner/con-artist, promised more cash. Never mind that the idea of driving through Beltway traffic to see Purdue on a Tuesday night in January was, nebulously, not as attractive as enduring the same commute to see, say, N.C. State. The money mattered, and Loh went for it. That move put Durkin competing not against Wake Forest and Duke and Virginia and Pittsburgh but instead against Michigan and Ohio State and Penn State. That matters. The environment and the identity shifted. And because of the negligence of Damon Evans — then an administrator overseeing football while apparently shutting his eyes, now incomprehensibly the athletic director — Durkin was allowed to build his big-time program in his big-time division of the Terrapins’ big-time conference however he saw fit. If that meant fostering an environment that routinely humiliated and embarrassed players, well, then, fine. No one was there to tell him to stop. [A timeline of events at the University of Maryland in Jordan McNair saga] Maryland’s past, Maryland’s integrity, no longer mattered. What mattered was getting in position to win in the Big Ten, oversight be damned. And what resulted was an athletic department in chaos, rife with infighting and backstabbing and confusion over the most basic reporting structure. Morale was low. Incompetence was high. James T. Brady, the chair of the regents who embarrassed himself and his organization this week, tried to quietly put the bulk of this on the two ousted characters here — Anderson and Rick Court, the renegade strength and conditioning coach. But the reality is, Durkin created the climate for his program within a dysfunctional athletic department devoid of leadership at the top but also scarred by the misguided mission of moving from the ACC to the Big Ten. The challenge now is for Maryland to somehow find its way again. Gary’s gone, and Ralph’s not coming back either. Maryland’s identity, even with Durkin mercifully removed, is wrapped up in Durkin’s errors and McNair’s death. Loh took a step toward remedying that Wednesday night, even if it put his own job in peril. But here’s what Maryland has to offer to any prospective leader: a broken athletic department headed by a woeful leader in Evans, playing in a conference its fan base hasn’t yet embraced against three perennial football powers against which it has almost no chance. It will take an exceptional person who can hire other exceptional people to lead Maryland out of these woods. But right now, given how off-center Maryland is, what sort of exceptional person would choose Maryland?

0bb032db8c793353d5543313da3e014d,Trump vows to end ‘crazy’ birthright citizenship in closing midterms appeal,"      By  Philip Rucker          Philip Rucker White House Bureau Chief  Email  Bio  Follow         October 31 at 10:01 PM   ESTERO, Fla. — President Trump introduced the polarizing issue of birthright citizenship as a central plank of his closing argument to voters here Wednesday night as he began his final campaign sprint to Election Day.  Trump said illegal immigration was the driving issue of the midterm elections and vowed that with enlarged Republican congressional majorities he would achieve his immigration priorities, including eliminating the constitutional right to citizenship for those born in the United States to undocumented immigrant parents. The president spoke at length about birthright citizenship, which he called “this crazy policy” that he said allowed “hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant children” born on U.S. soil to automatically become U.S. citizens and therefore eligible for every privilege and benefit of citizenship. “Birthright citizenship — you know all about it — we will keep the criminals, the drug dealers, we will keep them all out of our country,” Trump said. “We will get rid of all of this. We will end, finally, birthright citizenship. It’s costing us so many billions of dollars.” Trump said this week that he was considering signing an executive order ending birthright citizenship, though he acknowledged earlier Wednesday that it was likely to result in a legal challenge that could go all the way to the Supreme Court. Most legal scholars — as well as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) — have said the president does not have the power to eliminate the policy with the stroke of his pen because it is a constitutional right spelled out in the 14th Amendment.         window.havePowaBoot=true;  But Trump argued otherwise during his rollicking campaign rally at a Florida sports arena. “The Constitution does not require it,” the president said, because “illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.” The standing crowd of several thousand roared with approval. Trump has focused on the issue of immigration in the home stretch of the campaign as part of a strategy to stoke fear and galvanize his core supporters to turn out in support of Republican candidates for the Senate, House and governorships. As he has for days now, here at his Wednesday rally, Trump warned of the caravan of Central American migrants making its way north toward the U.S.-Mexico border. Though the migrants are hundreds of miles from the border, Trump this week deployed 5,200 U.S. troops there and said he was planning to send more.        if(typeof window.powaBoot===""function"")window.powaBoot();else{window.powaBootBoot=window.powaBootBoot||function(){if(null===document.querySelector('script[src*\x3d""powaBoot.js""]')){var script=document.createElement(""script"");var scripts=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];script.src=""https://d1pz6dax0t5mop.cloudfront.net/prod/powaBoot.js?_\x3d20180521B"";script.async=true;scripts.parentNode.insertBefore(script,scripts);window.havePowaBoot=true}};window.powaBootBoot()};  Trump seemed to preview action at the border. “It’s going to be very interesting over the next week,” he told the rally crowd, though the commander in chief did not offer any details of what he might have in store. “We’re getting prepared for the caravan, folks,” Trump said. “We’ve got a lot of rough people in those caravans. They are not angels. They are not.” He called the migrants “the opposition,” but added, “We’re tougher than anybody.” Trump then suggested that border agents might imprison migrants seeking asylum. “They’re not going to be released,” the president said. “It’s called catch, but we take the word ‘release’ out. We’re not going to be releasing them.” The crowd cheered. The president kicked off his sprint to Election Day with plans to hold at least 11 “Make America Great Again” rallies in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia. Trump won each of these states in 2016 and is trying to leverage his popularity in them to lift Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate and governorships to victory. He cast the election as a referendum on his presidency, saying, “Everything we have achieved” is at stake. He called this “one of the most important elections of our entire lives — though I will say, not as important as 2016.” Trump spotlighted Florida Republican candidates, including two who joined him on stage: Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for the Senate, and Rep. Ron DeSantis, who is running for governor. He also singled out two congressmen up for reelection, Reps. Francis Rooney and Matt Gaetz, though he notably said nothing about their records on behalf of Floridians. Rather, he praised their defense of him on cable television. “So great to me on television,” Trump said of Rooney. “I love it when he defends me. He’s brutal. He gets the job done.” Both Scott and DeSantis used their turn on Trump’s stage — behind the presidential lectern, with thousands of his devoted supporters watching from around the arena — to bash their respective Democratic opponents, Sen. Bill Nelson and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum. DeSantis called Gillum a “failed mayor” and said Gillum was “running on impeaching the president.” Then he brought up the federal public-corruption investigation of Tallahassee — Gillum has said he did nothing wrong — and said, “Maybe we should impeach Gillum as mayor of Tallahassee!” That inspired the crowd to chant, “Lock him up!” Trump opened his rally by condemning the massacre of 11 Jewish worshipers last Saturday at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, which the president visited Tuesday. The president denounced “the vile poison of anti-Semitism” but almost immediately turned to attack the news media for its coverage of the community’s peaceful protests of his visit. He accused the media of using the tragedy to sow anger. “We have forcefully condemned hatred, racism, bigotry and prejudice in all of its forms, but the media doesn’t want you to hear your story,” Trump said. “It’s not my story; it’s your story. And that’s why 33 percent of the people in this country believe the fake news is in fact — and I hate to say this — in fact the enemy of the people.” The crowd chanted in response, “CNN Sucks!” One woman in the stands could be heard loudly screaming the name of Jim Acosta, the network’s chief White House correspondent, who was covering the rally. Even as his fans shouted down journalists, chanted for a Democratic mayor to be jailed and cheered for the end of birthright citizenship, Trump tried to portray his movement — “the greatest movement in the history of our country,” as he put it — as one of harmony and inclusiveness. “Our movement is about love for fellow Americans,” Trump said. “Our movement is where everyone belongs.” ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-vows-to-end-crazy-birthright-citizenship-in-closing-midterms-appeal/2018/10/31/d350ab4c-dd30-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html,washingtonpost,www.washingtonpost.com,996,11

We’re not allowing people to come in.” Trump’s comments came a day after the general in charge of the border deployment said 5,239 active-duty troops would be heading to the border with more potentially to follow, in addition to the 2,092 members of the National Guard already there.  It wasn’t clear whether Trump’s 15,000 figure included the National Guard deployment. If the deployment reaches 15,000 troops, it would be roughly equivalent to the size of the U.S. military’s presence in Afghanistan and three times the size of the presence in Iraq. Already, the deployment is believed to be the largest of its kind in more than a century.  “The number of troops deployed will change each day as military forces flow into the operating area, but the initial estimate is that [the Defense Department] will have more than 7,000 troops supporting DHS across California, Arizona and Texas,” U.S. Northern Command said in a statement issued shortly after Trump spoke.        if(typeof window.powaBoot===""function"")window.powaBoot();else{window.powaBootBoot=window.powaBootBoot||function(){if(null===document.querySelector('script[src*\x3d""powaBoot.js""]')){var script=document.createElement(""script"");var scripts=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];script.src=""https://d1pz6dax0t5mop.cloudfront.net/prod/powaBoot.js?_\x3d20180521B"";script.async=true;scripts.parentNode.insertBefore(script,scripts);window.havePowaBoot=true}};window.powaBootBoot()};  Critics say the president’s decision to announce the deployments just days before the election is a political stunt designed to fire up a base concerned about immigration. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, rejected the criticism on Tuesday, saying the military was deploying to support the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection.  “The support that we provide to the Secretary for Homeland Security is practical support based on the request from the commissioner of customs and border police, so we don't do stunts in this department,” Mattis said.  [Border deployment puts Mattis and the military in political crosshairs] The defense secretary said the military had carried out similar missions within the United States following natural disasters. “We are there in support of the Secretary of Homeland Security, who needs additional military assistance,” he said.  A retired Marine Corps general, Mattis has long prioritized protecting the military from politicization, regularly emphasizing the apolitical traditions of the American armed forces. Deploying forces domestically in relation to such a politically charged issues risks eroding the public support that the armed forces enjoy with the American public.  Officials in Washington say that if thousands of migrants make it to the border and attempt to force their way through a crossing, the military will be needed and should be in place well in advance. The officials also hope the deployment will help deter the caravans from proceeding. Two caravans, each with more than 3,000 travelers, are trailed by at least two other groups of several hundred migrants. Many are fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras and intending to seek asylum in the United States. At the speed they are moving, they are weeks away from the border. The military’s active-duty deployment, dubbed Faithful Patriot, will send planning teams to coordinate operations, helicopter companies to move around CBP personnel, engineer battalions to construct barriers and medical units to treat patients, according to U.S. Northern Command. The forces will also erect temporary housing to support CBP and military personnel. Northern Command, which is overseeing the deployment, has identified 13 bases in Arizona, California and Texas close to the operations area near the border that will serve as primary logistics hubs for the deployment.  In addition, the command listed 38 units from 14 bases that had been identified to deploy to the southwest border.  Travis Sharp, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, estimated that a deployment of 15,000 active-duty troops through mid-December would cost from $90 million to $110 million. He calculated a 10,000-troop deployment of active-duty forces would cost about $60 million to $75 million. Gen. Terrence O’Shaughnessy, commander of Northern Command, said Tuesday that he could not give an estimate of the operation’s cost.

be54ff9c3df2f6dee3017499f157c959,"DJ Durkin, Maryland part ways following outcry over coach’s reinstatement","         window.havePowaBoot=true;       By  Rick Maese and          Rick Maese Reporter covering a variety of subjects, including health and safety, Olympics, legal and political issues in sports  Email  Bio  Follow         Nick Anderson          Nick Anderson Reporter covering higher education, national education policy and the global education market  Email  Bio  Follow         October 31 at 8:48 PM  In the face of mounting outrage and pressure from state lawmakers, students and the community, the University of Maryland fired football coach DJ Durkin on Wednesday, one day after allowing him to return to his position. In a letter to the university community, Wallace D. Loh, the president of the College Park campus, announced the decision, which directly defies a recommendation made by the University System of Maryland’s Board of Regents on Tuesday afternoon. Athletic Director Damon Evans informed Durkin of his ouster following the Terps’ practice Wednesday and then met with the entire team to inform players. A person familiar with the situation said Durkin was not fired for cause and that the school intends to buy him out of his contract. Durkin was in the third year of a five-year deal and is owed roughly $5.5 million. In his letter, Loh said that Durkin’s “departure is in the best interest of the University."" “This is a difficult decision, but it is the right one for our entire University,” Loh wrote. “I will devote the remaining months of my presidency to advancing the needed reforms in our Athletic Department that prioritize the safety and well-being of our student-athletes.” Durkin, 40, was not available to comment Wednesday night, and a message left with his attorney was not immediately returned. Durkin, who had been placed on administrative leave Aug. 11, had rejoined the team just one day earlier. He had been in limbo while the board oversaw two independent investigations into the football program he oversaw — one focused on the circumstances surrounding the June death of Jordan McNair, a 19-year-old offensive lineman, and the other centered on the culture of the football program, which followed media reports alleging abuse and bullying behavior by football staff members. School officials said Tuesday night that Durkin would be back on the sideline for Saturday’s game against Michigan State, but 24 hours later, offensive coordinator Matt Canada was again the interim coach and was expected to lead the 5-3 Terps through the remainder of the season. [Maryland football players react to DJ Durkin’s departure] The university’s decision capped a tumultuous day in which the board of regents’ recommendation that Durkin be retained was roundly criticized from all corners, with state lawmakers calling for a public hearing, several Maryland congressional representatives lambasting the board’s actions and Gov. Larry Hogan (R) calling on the regents to reconsider their controversial recommendations. “I am deeply troubled by the lack of transparency from the Board of Regents, and deeply concerned about how they could have possibly arrived at the decisions announced” Tuesday, Hogan said. All the while, Loh was in College Park taking in a series of meetings to assess the situation, according to a person close to the situation. He met with student government leaders, deans and vice presidents on campus, faculty senate representatives and community business leaders. “It was quite clear to him that DJ Durkin could not go out on the field on Saturday and represent the university,” the person said. The decision is not without risk for Loh. Multiple people familiar with the situation said he was strongly against the board of regents’ recommendation to allow Durkin back in the first place. Loh had met with the board in person last Friday, according to multiple people familiar with the meeting, and laid out his concerns about the possibility of Durkin returning. “In the meeting he told the board that all hell would break loose,” the person said. “He told the board it would be serious problem with the campus community and the public at large, but they were bound and determined that [Durkin] come back. They basically put a gun to his head and threatened him saying if he wouldn’t do it, they’d find a president who would.” Loh agreed to accept the board’s recommendations — which meant reinstating Durkin and retaining Evans — but then announced his intention to retire at the end of the academic year in June. The university system has pushed back on that account. In an interview Wednesday, prior to Maryland’s decision to fire Durkin, board chair James T. Brady said it’s “not accurate to say he was forced out.” “He received our recommendations, and made his decision,” Brady said.        if(typeof window.powaBoot===""function"")window.powaBoot();else{window.powaBootBoot=window.powaBootBoot||function(){if(null===document.querySelector('script[src*\x3d""powaBoot.js""]')){var script=document.createElement(""script"");var scripts=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];script.src=""https://d1pz6dax0t5mop.cloudfront.net/prod/powaBoot.js?_\x3d20180521B"";script.async=true;scripts.parentNode.insertBefore(script,scripts);window.havePowaBoot=true}};window.powaBootBoot()};  In deciding to reverse course, Loh did not consult with the board of regents, though Maryland officials did alert Robert Caret, the system’s chancellor, shortly before they informed Durkin of their decision. Technically, the board of regents doesn’t have say over any campus personnel decisions, other than the school president. Loh has received no assurances that the regents won’t punish him for flouting their recommendations. A spokesman for the university system did not immediately respond to a request to comment Wednesday night. “The board has been so determined to bring DJ back, it’s possible they could carry through on their threat to fire him right away,” the person close to the situation said. “But with so much public criticism at this point, it could be a risky move for them.” If the regents don’t take action, Loh, 73, could reconsider leaving the school in June, the person said. He had considered 2020 as his retirement target and has been urged by many state leaders and power brokers to not leave the school hastily. Throughout Wednesday, pressure mounted on the governing board to explain its endorsement of Durkin while cutting ties with its academic leader. Much of the ire was directed at the 17 regents, all politically appointed volunteers, who had overseen the process since August and spent 12 days mulling their options. “From the beginning there was never an illusion that we were going to come up with a decision that everyone was going to love,” Brady said Wednesday afternoon. “ … There was no perfect answer."" [Svrluga: Maryland rights a wrong — but it remains a long way from being out of the woods] State and federal power brokers, particularly, amplified the pressure that had been heaped on the board in the previous 24 hours. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D- Md.), for example, echoed the sentiments expressed by many, saying he didn't “understand how the coach remains and the president is basically asked to leave.""  To that end, in Annapolis, state legislators called a Nov. 15 hearing to hold the regents to account.  State lawmakers control funding for the University of Maryland system, and though House Appropriations Chair Del. Maggie McIntosh (D-Baltimore) acknowledged her committee has no authority over employment decisions, she said lawmakers can use their bully pulpit to force transparency about how and why those decisions are made. By Wednesday afternoon, 25 Democratic state lawmakers, including several influential committee chairs and party leaders, sent a sharply worded letter to Caret and the regents calling their actions “shameful” and “unacceptable.”  For many, the issue revolves solely around the board of regents and Brady, its chair. The board, which met behind closed doors five times to discuss the football program, has refused to disclose the tally of its vote. Brady said he didn’t recall the breakdown but said it was a “clear majority.” Most other board members either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. ""We knew that whatever decision was made, it was not going to be popular,"" said Barry Gossett, vice president of the board, said Wednesday afternoon. “There was no easy choice.""         The choice the regents made proved perhaps more contentious than anticipated. Several players tweeted their anger Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, upset at what they perceived as a lack of consequences for the death of their teammate, McNair. Students were planning a campus demonstration for Thursday to voice their concerns about the outcome. When news of Durkin’s firing spread Wednesday evening, both groups expressed satisfaction. “Justice served,” offensive lineman Ellis McKennie tweeted Wednesday evening. “Jordan McNair can begin to Rest In Peace. Go terps! See you Saturday!” “Pressure busts pipes doesn’t it??” linebacker Tre Watson wrote in a tweet. Jonathan Allen, Maryland’s student body president, said, “I think it says a lot about the power of student advocacy.” Former University of Maryland System chancellor William B. Kirwan and former Board of Regents chairman James L. Shea issued a statement late Wednesday saying they “strongly support” Loh’s decision to fire Durkin. ""Dr. Loh's action will be remembered as a courageous and important decision in Maryland higher education,"" the statement reads. “Dr. Loh has taken this action despite an apparent ultimatum from the Board of Regents that he must retain Coach Durkin or else be terminated as president immediately. In effect, the Board of Regents was taking the unprecedented action of determining who would be the university's football coach.""   The McNair family has been outspoken in its criticisms of Durkin, and Billy Murphy, the family’s Baltimore-based attorney, lauded the university’s decision Wednesday night. He called Durkin “a cancer to the entire football program” and said that Brady should also be removed from his position as board chair. “It was a completely misguided and unbelievably bone-head decision that defied all reason, common sense, and morality,” Murphy said. While a spokesman for the University System of Maryland declined to comment on the school’s decision Wednesday night, others offered praise as news of Durkin’s termination spread. “Dr. Loh’s firing of Coach Durkin is the right decision and the decision that had to be made if the UMD community was going to ever move forward,” Rep. Anthony G. Brown (D-Md.) said. “President Loh was the only leader who had the moral fortitude to accept responsibility for Jordan McNair’s death, and I believe he will continue to act boldly and guide the Athletic Department to a safer, more sustainable future that students, student-athletes, and the University of Maryland family can be proud of.”       Roman Stubbs, Emily Giambalvo, Susan Svrluga, Erin Cox, Ovetta Wiggins and Keith L.

1ffd415e373bea838ae29f277e8e8000,Trump and the Saudis keep fumbling after Khashoggi’s killing,"          By  Ishaan Tharoor          Ishaan Tharoor Reporter covering foreign affairs, geopolitics and history  Email  Bio  Follow        November 1 at 12:59 AM    Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know? Sign up for the Today’s WorldView newsletter.    (Evan Vuccie)  On Wednesday, nearly a month after journalist Jamal Khashoggi entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and vanished, Turkish authorities made their strongest statement yet about what happened to the dissident writer. Khashoggi was “strangled as soon as he entered the consulate,"" said Irfan Fidan, Istanbul’s chief prosecutor, calling the act part of a Saudi team’s “premeditated plans.” Khashoggi’s body, “after being strangled, was subsequently destroyed by being dismembered, once again confirming the planning of the murder,” Fidan added. This conclusive declaration followed the departure from Istanbul of Saudi prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb, who had been dispatched to investigate Khashoggi’s disappearance. Despite the kingdom’s vows of transparency and cooperation, Mojeb, according to my colleagues, neither gave the location of Khashoggi’s body to his Turkish counterparts nor identified the supposed “local collaborator” who helped dispose of his remains. Turkish investigators are reportedly pursuing a theory that Khashoggi’s body was dissolved in acid. A senior Turkish official told my colleagues that “Saudi officials seemed primarily interested in finding out what evidence the Turkish authorities had against the perpetrators” of Khashoggi’s killing and that Turkish officials doubted Riyadh was “keen on genuinely cooperating.”   .@jaketapper, @NickKristof, @jrezaian and other leading journalists read portions of Jamal Khashoggi's final @washingtonpost column. Retweet to help us demand justice. https://t.co/x5CLrJjb0d pic.twitter.com/qlBWNEb8ru— Amnesty International (@amnestyusa) October 29, 2018    For weeks, Riyadh has engaged in a series of obfuscations, denials and delays as international anger mounted over Khashoggi’s apparent death. Eventually, the Saudi government acknowledged that Khashoggi had died in its custody. It blamed his killing on supposed rogue elements involved in a botched Saudi operation to detain Khashoggi and said they would be tried in Saudi courts. But Riyadh has yet to formally acknowledge the conclusions of the Turkish investigation — or publicly disclose its own. As readers of Today’s WorldView know, the Khashoggi scandal has badly damaged the reputation of Saudi Arabia and its ambitious crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, a repeated target of criticism in Khashoggi’s columns for The Washington Post. President Trump has been a conspicuous cheerleader of MBS — as the 33-year-old royal is often referred to — but even he eventually spoke out against Riyadh’s handling of the matter. “Obviously there’s been deception and there’s been lies,” Trump told The Washington Post last month when pressed on Saudi Arabia’s shifting explanations. “Their stories are all over the place.” He nevertheless chose to defend MBS, who has reportedly struck up a close personal rapport with Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and has been a vociferous supporter of Trump’s efforts to confront Iran. Trump also pointed to tens of billions of dollars in Saudi arms purchases from U.S. companies as a reason to not disrupt ties with Riyadh. “He’s seen as a person who can keep things under check,” Trump said. “I mean that in a positive way.” He added that MBS is “considered by far the strongest person” and that “he truly loves his country.” But while the White House may be keen to back its man in Riyadh, the rest of Washington is less enthusiastic. A number of prominent lobbying firms dropped their Saudi contracts in reaction to Khashoggi’s murder, and some foreign governments have trotted out tentative punishments. Politicians in Congress, including senators briefed by intelligence officials on the evidence collected by Turkish authorities, have loudly denounced Riyadh. On Wednesday, a group of Republican senators called on the White House to scrap talks over a U.S.-Saudi civilian nuclear deal.   Lindsey Graham: MBS is a ""wrecking ball"" who had Khashoggi murdered, he's ""toxic"" and he's ""gotta go.""""This guy is a wrecking ball, he had this guy murdered in a consulate in Turkey, and to expect me to ignore it, I feel used and abused."" (via Fox) pic.twitter.com/aUnZQzsdb8— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) October 16, 2018    Other lawmakers in Washington have trained their ire specifically on MBS, whose take-lots-of-prisoners rule is a departure from traditional Saudi caution. “Saudi Arabia’s allies and clients realize the danger of crossing Prince Mohammed, who has shown the world that he can be reckless and ruthless,” wrote Mohamad Bazzi, an associate professor at New York University. “Those who stay in the prince’s good graces hope that he will reward fealty, especially since he has positioned himself to rule for decades as Saudi Arabia’s next king.” Yet the crisis over Khashoggi has called MBS’s own position into question. As my colleagues reported in a lengthy exposé, the crown prince reached his place of power within the court by ruthlessly sidelining, arresting or otherwise subduing rivals within the royal family, including some princes well known in Washington circles. The pressure is now on his father, the aging King Salman, to rein in his son. “The question now is whether King Salman will decide there is wisdom in curtailing Mohammed’s powers, or at least in appearing to do so,"" my colleagues wrote. Reports of the return of one of the king’s younger brothers, who had been living abroad out of fear of arrest, deepened speculation over the maneuvering taking place within the palace. One hypothetical scenario would see MBS compelled to share power with a more senior relative, who would work to restore international confidence in the kingdom. “There’s going to be Americans, presumably even in the Trump administration, who are going to be telling the Saudis you’ve got to put some guardrails around this guy, and the most public way you can do that is by having a senior member of the family [become] foreign minister,” Gregory Gause, an expert on the kingdom at Texas A&M University, said to HuffPost. Indeed, the administration — which seemingly gave MBS carte blanche to wage a ruinous war in Yemen, trigger a regional crisis by blockading Qatar and allegedly detain the Lebanese prime minister — may be reaching its limits. This week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for hostilities in Yemen to end within 30 days. When Saudi Arabia was faced with international criticism over Yemen in the past, the Trump administration frequently rushed to Riyadh’s defense — even after evidence showed that a Saudi missile strike had killed dozens of Yemeni schoolchildren. But after Khashoggi’s murder, the mood is changing. “It’s thrown open the doors of doubt to the entire Saudi version of the war in Yemen,” Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen scholar at Oxford University, said to The Post’s Sudarsan Raghavan. “It is no longer able to just tell the world what it wants it to think without the world now being suspicious and skeptical.” Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

4d59d9522d40ba7f3991ef8f617e5f2e,Why Britain should vote on Brexit again,"      By  Sebastian Mallaby     Sebastian Mallaby  Email  Bio  Follow         October 31 at 3:32 PM   Sebastian Mallaby, author of “The Man Who Knew: The Life & Times of Alan Greenspan,” is the Paul A. Volcker senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations and a contributing columnist for The Post.  How should pragmatic centrists respond to populism? One answer, delivered with a wringing of the hands and a grimace of contrition, is to acknowledge the rage that populism expresses, even to the point of co-opting its playbook. Open immigration rules, for example, improve the lives of migrants and boost growth; but electorates have sent a clear message that they resent foreigners, so perhaps their democratic wish must be respected. Open trade boosts prosperity, but perhaps protectionism is a small price to pay for signaling to regular voters that the globalist elite has heard them. Yet there are times when such concessions backfire. Britain’s fight over Brexit is one. Two years after Britain voted to leave the European Union, there is a clear case for a second referendum. It’s not just that yanking Britain out of its most important trading relationship will be costly. It’s that yanking Britain out won’t deliver the promise of “taking back control” that Brexit supporters cherish. The deal now emerging is likely to require Britain to continue to abide by at least some European rules. It will involve some kind of payments to Brussels. It will cause stresses in the relationship between mainland Britain and Ireland, and perhaps between England and Scotland. It will not make Brexiteers happy. Because the emerging deal is a mess — a dog’s Brexit, the wags say — it may well be blocked in Parliament. Purist Brexiteer “headbangers” in the ruling Conservative Party denounce what they see as an insufficiently clean break, and there may be enough of them to prevent passage. If that happens, Britain could leave the European Union without a deal, which would disrupt everything from auto supply chains to peace in Ireland. Alternatively, Britain could put the question to a second referendum, allowing voters to choose among three options: the compromise negotiated by the government, a no-deal hard break or remaining in the European Union. To populists and their appeasers, a second referendum is anathema. The first was billed as the most important vote in a generation, and 72.2 percent of the electorate turned out, the highest share in a national contest in more than two decades. In the face of that mandate, the argument goes, elites have no right to tell people to vote again so they can deliver the “right” answer. Besides, if a second referendum went in favor of Remain, Brexiteers would argue that this merely made the score 1-1, so there ought to be a tiebreaker. Maybe this is men’s Grand Slam tennis rather than women’s? Why not five referendums? This objection would be compelling if Brexit voters were being deprived of something they dearly wanted. However, the fact that the most enthusiastic Brexiteers are poised to vote against the exit deal suggests otherwise. Top Brexit standard-bearers, notably former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, have resigned from the government to protest the emerging compromise, with one saying it would make Britain a “vassal state.” Most Brexit voters still want out of Europe, but they feel let down by the convoluted way it’s happening. That leaves the second objection to a fresh referendum: that it would be hard to organize. Enabling legislation would have to go through Parliament. The phrasing of the questions would take time, all the more so because there would be three options for voters — the leave compromise, the hard break and the Remain U-turn. Preparations would extend beyond the Brexit deadline next March, so the European Union would have to agree to postpone B-Day. But these objections, too, are underwhelming. Europe would have every incentive to agree to a postponement: Brexit will mainly hurt Britain, but it will also hurt its neighbors. And while a referendum with more than two options may sound complex, it’s not impossible. In 1977, Australia used a referendum to select one national anthem out of four. An alternative-vote system, in which the second choices of the bottom-ranked option are added to the tallies of the top two, offers an intuitively fair way to determine the outcome. The truth is that Britain has no easy way forward. If Brexit is derailed, Brexit voters will feel cheated and the backlash could be serious. But if a dog’s Brexit is served up, Brexit voters may still feel unsatisfied and Remainers will be disgusted. And because Brexit will crimp tax revenue and constrain government spending on hospitals and schools, its effect over the long run will be to make everyone angrier. An alternative-vote referendum could plausibly yield victory for any of the three results. But at least it would avoid the suspicion that the nation had stumbled into a fudge that pleases nobody because political leaders handled the negotiations incompetently. If populism shows that mainstream politicians have not listened enough to regular voters, there is no shame in asking voters to express their views a second time.

62879aa022e45b723146ae950dc5103f,Trump’s moves on immigration roil midterm campaign for both parties,"      By  Seung Min Kim          Seung Min Kim White House reporter  Email  Bio  Follow         October 31 at 9:58 PM  President Trump’s vows to end birthright citizenship and dispatch a growing number of troops to the border have scrambled the final days of the midterm campaign for both parties — repelling moderate House Republicans in swing districts but prompting some red-state Senate Democrats to align themselves with Trump’s hard-line stances.  Those shifting alliances reflect how much Trump — while his party would like to focus on the economy and Democrats want the on spotlight health care — has dictated the rhetorical terms of the campaign. Trump on Wednesday launched a six-day, eight-state swing that will take him to conservative states as he seeks to retain GOP control of the Senate — with immigration sure to remain front and center. Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric propelled him to the GOP presidential nomination and the White House in 2016, and he is counting on similarly inflammatory words and images to help the GOP hold its congressional majorities.  The president tweeted a video Wednesday that featured Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican immigrant in the United States illegally who was sentenced to death this year after he was convicted of killing two police officers in California — using the image to make the demand: “Vote Republican now!” Before taking off for a campaign swing to Fort Myers, Fla., Trump also floated the idea of deploying as many as 15,000 troops to the border — just days after the Pentagon said it would send about 5,200 active-duty troops there, in addition to the 2,000 National Guard members already present. He also claimed without evidence that the population of immigrants in the country illegally could be as large as 25 million or 30 million. The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute puts the estimated size of the undocumented population at 11.3 million.  Trump also dismissed suggestions that he was fearmongering with his increasingly aggressive immigration rhetoric, such as hi frequent references to a caravan of migrants heading north, including many destitute families, that is still hundreds of miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border.          window.havePowaBoot=true;  [Migrant caravan: U.S. troops at the border will be armed. Here are the rules of engagement.] “Oh they’ll be here fast. They’re trying to get up any way they can,” Trump told reporters shortly before leaving for the first of his 11 campaign rallies through Election Day. “We’re going to be prepared. They’re not coming into our country.” At the rally, Trump told the crowd that “we’re getting prepared for the caravan, folks.” “You don’t have to worry about that,” he said. Providing no evidence, Trump continued: “They’ve got a lot of rough people in that caravan. They are not angels.” Trump’s legally questionable call to revoke birthright citizenship through a unilateral executive order has drawn opposition from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) — prompting a presidential rebuke Wednesday, delivered via Twitter — as well as rejections from House Republicans in competitive reelection contests, such as Reps. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) and Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.).         if(typeof window.powaBoot===""function"")window.powaBoot();else{window.powaBootBoot=window.powaBootBoot||function(){if(null===document.querySelector('script[src*\x3d""powaBoot.js""]')){var script=document.createElement(""script"");var scripts=document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0];script.src=""https://d1pz6dax0t5mop.cloudfront.net/prod/powaBoot.js?_\x3d20180521B"";script.async=true;scripts.parentNode.insertBefore(script,scripts);window.havePowaBoot=true}};window.powaBootBoot()};  But another Republican candidate in a closely contested House race, Maria Elvira Salazar, said Wednesday that the clause of the 14th Amendment that provides the constitutional underpinning for birthright citizenship “needs to be reviewed,” according to the Miami Herald.  “I think the president is saying what I think my community shares, the fact that we do not want abuses,” said Salazar, who is running for election in the district that is being vacated by retiring congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) — and that Democrat Hillary Clinton won in 2016 by 19 percentage points. “The Constitution says very clearly that those that are born here are citizens, but we need to see to what extent.” On the Democratic side, Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), a moderate running for reelection in a conservative state, appeared to leave the door open to legislation that would end birthright citizenship, the concept that nearly anyone born on American soil is automatically a citizen of the United States.  “We have to take a look at that legislation,” Donnelly said during a debate Tuesday evening about a bill that would revoke the right, adding, “I’d want to see that legislation and make sure it was constitutional and review it first.” Asked about those comments Wednesday, Donnelly’s campaign released a statement from the senator saying the 14th Amendment is “clear” — and “what’s also clear is that our immigration system is broken.” “As I have done in the past, I will work with both parties to find a solution that secures our borders and fixes our broken immigration laws,” Donnelly said. But Donnelly is far from the lone Democratic Senate candidate in recent days to adopt immigration stances that seem almost Trumpian in nature.  In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) urged Trump to “use every tool he has at his disposal” to halt the caravan of migrants traveling north to the United States, adding, “I 100 percent back him up on that.” Calling for a speedier process for migrants seeking asylum, McCaskill said, “I do not want our borders overrun, and I support the president’s efforts to make sure they’re not.” And in Tennessee, Democrat Phil Bredesen released an ad Tuesday that promoted his decision as governor more than a decade ago to deploy 1,600 members of the Tennessee National Guard to the southern border. That ad was accompanied by an op-ed in the Tennessean that warned both parties against using the caravan issue to “inflame passions” over the sensitive topic. “Actions speak louder than words,” the ad says. “In 2006, when the president said he needed help to secure the border, Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen didn’t wait to be asked. And he didn’t play any politics.” Immigration has become an increasingly central issue for the GOP in other closely watched Senate races. A CNN poll released Wednesday showed that immigration is now the top issue for Republican voters in Nevada and Arizona, with 42 percent of Republicans in Nevada now saying immigration is the most important issue in their Senate vote, while 50 percent in Arizona say the same.  In Tennessee, immigration has risen to the second-most-important issue for voters there in internal Republican polling, according to one official with knowledge of the numbers.  “I’m not surprised to see the scramble [among Democrats]. I think at this stage, it’s a little inauthentic,” said GOP strategist Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Immigration “has a significant resonance within the base of the Republican Party, but it has more independent pull than one would think.” The contrast between the parties has become sharper this year, Holmes added, particularly as leading Democratic politicians increasingly embraced liberal positions on immigration, such as abolishing the federal agency that enforces U.S. immigration laws.  Tyler Moran, the director of the Immigration Hub, which advises a wide range of progressive organizations on immigration policy, said that the moderates taking a more conservative tack on immigration were the outliers and that congressional and gubernatorial candidates nationwide were largely “rejecting Trump’s strategy of lies and division.” “First of all, every single one of those Democrats voted for immigration reform,” said Moran, who worked on immigration issues under then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and in the Obama White House. “Yes, in their tough races, I wouldn’t agree with the way they’re approaching this. But we have a big-tent approach to immigration.” Democratic officials also said that moderates in closely watched Senate races this fall have long touted their border-security bona fides — far before Trump amped up his focus on the issue as part of his closing argument in the midterms. “Among Republicans, we’ve certainly seen that immigration more regularly tops the list of issues,” said Lauren Passalacqua, the communications director at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “But I think what we have seen that is consistent is that among independents, obviously Democrats but even among Republicans, the Venn diagram is still health care.” ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-moves-on-immigration-roil-midterm-campaign-for-both-parties/2018/10/31/ce963a30-dd40-11e8-aa33-53bad9a881e8_story.html,washingtonpost,www.washingtonpost.com,1255,11
aa6c79b2838f484c6cfdff56900db2c1,"Missouri’s Josh Hawley is an actual, not a pretend, conservative","          By  George F. Will          George F. Will Columnist covering politics and domestic and foreign affairs  Email  Bio  Follow         Columnist  October 31 at 6:20 PM     CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo.  Here in Missouri’s southeast, which calls itself the Bootheel and nurses a genial distrust of the state’s metropolitan fleshpots (St. Louis, Kansas City), the loudspeaker is blasting out John Mellencamp’s “Small Town” as Josh Hawley’s cowboy boots alight from his campaign bus at this stop on the “Stop Schumer, Fire Claire Tour.” Before he became a Senate candidate, and before he became Missouri’s attorney general — after Stanford, Yale Law School (where he met his wife, Erin; they clerked together for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.) — Hawley grew up in a rural Missouri county . Erin Hawley, the daughter of fifth-generation New Mexico ranchers, also is comfortable speaking beneath slate-gray-seeping Midwestern skies, in front of enormous bins of rice, to a small but grateful gathering of farmers. Josh Hawley reminds them that he has litigated against the Waters of the United States rule, by which the federal government torments farmers, treating any occasionally soggy parcel of land as ripe for regulation. While in private practice, he supported Hobby Lobby’s successful appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that the company’s free exercise of religion was denied by Obamacare’s requirement that employers provide employees with all kinds of contraception, including abortifacient drugs. This keenly interests whoever filled a field alongside Interstate 55 with little white crosses for victims of abortions. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill might soon be relieved of the strain of pretending to not be what she is — much more liberal than her state. Until recently, Missouri was America’s bellwether: It voted with the winner in all but one 20th-century presidential election. (In 1956, it favored Adlai Stevenson, who hailed from across the river in Illinois.) But in 2008, John McCain won Missouri narrowly (3,903 votes), Mitt Romney won by nine points in 2012 and Donald Trump by 18.5 points , so it now is much more Republican than the nation. McCaskill, 65, has been in politics almost as long (36 years ) as Hawley, 38,  has been alive. The timing of McCaskill’s first Senate campaign was lucky, and her second campaign illustrated the axiom that luck is the residue of design. In 2006, a blue tsunami washed her into the Senate. In 2012, she selected her opponent by funding ads that solemnly warned Republican primary voters, many of them very conservative, that Todd Akin was very conservative. They nominated him, and he self-immolated with the interesting physiological theory that “legitimate rape” rarely results in pregnancy. McCaskill boasts that she supposedly ranks as “the fifth-most-likely senator to break with my party.” But the difference between the fifth-most-likely and the least likely is insignificant in an era when the Senate votes on almost nothing. And on something that mattered, the Supreme Court nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch, she was conspicuously not one of the three Democrats who voted for him. Her campaign has run an ad featuring a make-believe conversation between Two Ordinary Guys, one of whom says, “Claire’s not one of those crazy Democrats.” This, which drove Missouri Democrats crazy, was probably a response to the post-Brett M. Kavanaugh backlash against Democrats, which has probably propelled Hawley to a mid-single-digit lead. If elected, Hawley will be the youngest senator (two years younger than Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton ) in a body where today the average age is 63. Though never is heard a discouraging word from Hawley about his party’s leader, Hawley is educated and thoughtful, so it is possible to hope that he is as insincere in his praise of the president as McCaskill is in her insistence that she is really not like those anti-Kavanaugh hysterics led by almost all of her Democratic colleagues in the Senate. She supported the gross violations of due process that were mandated by the Education Department in response to hysteria about the fictional “campus rape culture.” This is an era of “let’s pretend” politics, as Republicans who control both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue run trillion-dollar deficits during full employment while pretending to believe in fiscal rectitude, and Senate Democrats pretend to be thoughtful while their combined votes on two Supreme Court and 29 appellate court nominees are 391 for and 1,084 against. Hawley, who hopes to serve on the Judiciary Committee (a Republican seat is opening: Utah’s Orrin G. Hatch is retiring), is an actual, not a pretend, conservative — though he has written a serious but too-admiring book mistakenly calling Theodore Roosevelt a conservative. Hawley can be part of the GOP’s intelligent future, if it chooses to have one. Read more from George F. Will’s archive or follow him on Facebook.

Now they’re saying I can do it just with an executive order.” — President Trump, explaining this week that he could unilaterally end the Constitution’s protection of birthright citizenship Jan. 1, 2019 (BREITBART) — President Trump, under his newly discovered authority to rewrite the citizenship requirements of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, today issued an order restricting U.S. citizenship to the following individuals and groups: “My family” “Kellyanne Conway (but not George!)” “Sarah Sanders (dad okay, too)” “Kanye West” “Russians living at Trump properties” “Residents of Trump Tower” “Lou Dobbs” “Sean Hannity” “Tucker Carlson” “Steve Doocy” “Steve King” “Stephen Miller” After signing the order, the president told reporters: “It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment to restrict citizenship to friends and family. Guess what? You don’t. Now they’re saying I can do it just with an executive order.” Jan. 8, 2019 (BREITBART) — A federal district court judge struck down President Trump’s orders today awarding citizenship only to friends and family, saying, “You can’t run the country like it’s a Manhattan co-op.” Trump, saying the ruling was invalid because one of the judge’s ancestors came from Mexico, responded by issuing a new executive order eliminating Article III of the Constitution and replacing the federal judiciary with Judge Jeanine Pirro. “Guess what?” Trump told reporters after the signing. “I can do it just with an executive order.” Jan. 15, 2019 (BREITBART) — President Trump, using his expanding authority to revise the Constitution by executive action, ordered the summary deportation of all 11 million illegal immigrants by next week — just in time to keep his promise to have them out of the country within two years of taking office. After the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit to stop without-cause searches of every American home, business and vehicle, Trump issued a second order requiring the imprisonment without charges of all ACLU lawyers, as well as Robert S. Mueller III, Michael Avenatti, Michael Cohen, Omarosa Manigault Newman and “NFL players who present a risk of kneeling.” “It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment to do unreasonable searches and seizures and to eliminate due process,” Trump told reporters as he boarded Marine One for a campaign event. “Guess what? You don’t.” Jan. 22, 2019 (BREITBART) — President Trump issued a new executive memorandum today ordering the Justice Department to immediately end all civil and criminal prosecutions, “particularly any that mention ‘collusion,’ ‘taxes’ and ‘emoluments.’ ” The order redirects 100 percent of Justice Department resources toward investigating Hillary Clinton’s emails. Top department officials resigned, saying the order violated the constitutional requirement that the president “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” But acting attorney general Lindsey O. Graham said Trump’s order overrode Article II, Section III of the Constitution. “Guess what?” Graham said. “He can do it.” Jan. 29, 2019 (BREITBART) — President Trump, responding to media criticism of his recent executive orders, issued a memorandum revising the First Amendment to abolish all media, allowing only: Fox News, Breitbart, Daily Caller, Alex Jones, Gab and QAnon. Dean Baquet, executive editor of the Failing New York Times, responded by saying, “[CENSORED].” Feb. 5, 2019 (BREITBART) — President Trump, responding to a call by Democrats for his impeachment, issued an executive order rescinding the Constitution’s Article II impeachment provisions , ending the terms of all current members of Congress and replacing them with the Mar-a-Lago board of directors. “Guess what?” said departing House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who had served one month on the job. “I agree with the president.” Feb. 12, 2019 (BREITBART) — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have not been seen in public since criticizing President Trump’s expanding use of executive orders to revise the Constitution. The disappearances are possibly related to the president’s latest executive order decreeing that anybody who criticizes his executive orders is no longer covered by the Eighth Amendment’s protections against “cruel and unusual” punishment. Tom Cotton, who identified himself as “acting defense secretary,” said Mattis and the chiefs were on “an extended visit” to Guantanamo Bay. Feb. 19, 2019 (BREITBART) — Lady Liberty herself, in a rare Oval Office appearance, made an emotional appeal to President Trump to stop “rewriting the Constitution by fiat.” Lady Liberty, known widely from French romantic paintings and a statue in New York Harbor, made little progress. Trump, according to two people familiar with the meeting, told her: “It must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees.” “Guess what?” Trump told Fox News shortly after a tearful Lady Liberty departed the West Wing. “When you’re a star, they let you do that.” Read more from Dana Milbank’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

It symbolizes the death and rebirth of the sun. (Pavel Volkov)     A girl during the Yarilo holiday celebrations. (Pavel Volkov)  For centuries, Russia’s pagans practiced their faith on the fringes. But lately, the community of rodnovers, or neopagans, is growing — and finding a home in the country’s biggest cities. Russia’s first pagans were largely wiped out by the Russian Christian church 1,000 years ago. But a modern iteration of the movement was reborn during the collapse of the Soviet Union. “The collapse of the communist system in Eastern Europe enabled the few small Pagan movements in the region to surface in the public sphere,” political scientist Kaarina Aitamurto wrote in the journal E-International Relations. “At the beginning of the 1990s, they gained momentum in virtually all ex-socialist countries.” Followers say their polytheistic faith honors Russia’s Slavic roots and allows them to maintain a distinct national identity. Today, there are thousands of self-described rodnovers in Siberia, Volga, Moscow and St. Petersburg. The group defines its faith loosely, pulling traditions and beliefs from ancient Slavic tribes. Though customs vary from place to place, many rodnovers celebrate the “solar holidays” that mark the change of the season by dressing in costume and performing short plays. At some ceremonies, there are sacrifices, dances and communal meals. Rodnovers often worship in Slavic-style temples that feature images of the gods.    At the beginning of the celebration on Kupalo, people make a circle in the pagan temple. (Pavel Volkov)     A man prepares for a pagan wedding.

df0f0e996053883d00a1080f64d7d519,Divers find ‘black box’ from crashed Indonesian Lion Air jet ,"      By Ainur Rohmah ,    Stanley Widianto and     Shibani Mahtani          Shibani Mahtani Reporter covering Southeast Asia  Email  Bio  Follow         November 1 at 5:15 AM   JAKARTA, Indonesia — A “black box” that investigators believe to be the flight data recorder from a Lion Air jet was discovered off the Java coast on Thursday, officials said, a crucial discovery that will help investigators determine how an almost-new plane fell out of clear skies in one of the worst commercial air disasters in recent years.   On Thursday morning, divers discovered the bright orange flight recorder 100 feet underwater close to the coast of Jakarta. An airplane has two flight recorders, one that captures flight data and another that records the pilot and his co-pilot in the cockpit.   “This is most likely the flight data recorder,” said Bambang Irawan, an investigator at Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee. “We are still looking for the cockpit voice recorder.”  The crash has so far puzzled experts, who without data from the plane have only been able to speculate on what caused the plane to go down on Monday morning just 13 minutes after takeoff, crashing into the sea with such speed and force that no victim has been found intact. Finding the flight recorder — which sometimes can take years to track down or is never found at all after a crash — is a crucial to piece together the last moments of the ill-fated flight.  The flight data recorder, which records readings from the electronic systems of an aircraft, would likely be brought to the National Transportation Safety Committee laboratory where investigators would begin to look through the information, said Alvin Lie, a former member of the Indonesian parliament and an aviation analyst. “Analysis can be done, but it is not complete without the CVR,” he said, referring to the cockpit voice recorder, which still has not been located. Lion Air 610, a twin-engine Boeing 737 Max 8, took off from Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport for the mining region of Pangkal Pinang early Monday. Just a few minutes into the flight, the pilot asked permission to return to the airport, a request that was granted.  Radar showed the aircraft climbed and descended erratically and that its speed increased dramatically before it lost contact with air traffic controllers.  [Indonesian divers hear ‘pings’ as they zero in on Lion Air wreckage] Budi Karya Sumadi, Indonesia’s Transportation Minister, said 10 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes operated by Lion Air and one operated by Garuda Airlines, Indonesia’s national airline, have been grounded and are being inspected and evaluated by the transportation safety committee. They will discuss the details of their evaluation with Boeing, he added, which has sent a team of engineers to Jakarta.  His ministry has also asked Lion Air to suspend the licenses of a number of officials, including its maintenance director, engineering director and flight maintenance director, while they aid in the investigation.   Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s biggest aviation market, according to the Center for Aviation, a travel market research company, bolstered by a rising middle class and the necessity of air travel to navigate the large archipelago of islands. But the country has suffered from safety oversights in the past.  Its airlines were banned from flying to the United States in 2007 because they were “deficient in one or more areas, such as technical expertise, trained personnel, record-keeping, or inspection procedures,” the Federal Aviation Administration said. The FAA lifted the ban in 2016 after the country’s airlines showed signs of improvement. The European Union similarly barred Indonesian carriers from flying into European airspace from 2007 until June.  Mahtani reported from Hong Kong. Timothy McLaughlin in Hong Kong contributed to this report.   Read more: Boeing stock tumbles after its 737 plane goes down in Indonesia Indonesia says it had no warning Saudi Arabia would be executing maid All 189 onboard feared dead after Indonesian plane crashes into sea Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/divers-findblack-box-from-crashed-indonesian-lion-air-jet/2018/11/01/e1b96ba8-dd60-11e8-b732-3c72cbf131f2_story.html,washingtonpost,www.washingtonpost.com,625,10

A solemn tour of Tree of Life synagogue with his family; a quiet conversation with the rabbi who escaped Saturday’s mass shooting there; a private meeting with a widow. Flowers for the dead, a visit to a hospital, and then Trump departed Pittsburgh without a single public statement — let alone one of the bombastic speeches so many had feared he would bring to this city in mourning. But that was Tuesday. On Wednesday, Trump was back in Washington, back on Twitter, and back to recasting all events in his immediate wake as a victory story for Donald Trump.   Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day. We were treated so warmly.

We were treated so warmly. Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful!”   This sign about sums up the attitude of every Pittsburgh resident I talked to today. pic.twitter.com/xfxmLsGhZw— Kyle Swenson (@kyletalking) October 30, 2018    From all appearances, the president and first lady Melania Trump were warmly welcomed by Rabbi Jeffrey Myers — unlike the mayor, the county administrator, the governor, several tens of thousands of people who signed an open letter telling Trump he was “not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism,” and many hundreds of residents who staged a decidedly not-small protest a few blocks from his motorcade.    People join a solidarity march in response to the visit Oct. 30 by President Trump to Pittsburgh and the Tree of Life synagogue in the city's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. (Justin Merriman for The Washington Post)  ""This didn’t happen in a vacuum,” said Ardon Shorr, one of about 100 people who had jammed a street corner several blocks from the synagogue an hour before Trump’s plane landed. “There is a growing trend of white nationalism. And that has been enabled by Trump, who traffics in the kind of conspiracy theories that we know were foremost in the mind of the shooter last Saturday.”    A woman is comforted by a man in a tense moment during the solidarity march Oct. 30. (Justin Merriman for The Washington Post)  By the time Air Force One arrived at Pittsburgh International Airport, the protest had swelled to about 2,000 people. The demonstration had been organized at the last minute, as had Trump’s visit: The White House had not announced until late Monday that he would be visiting Pittsburgh — despite a request from the mayor and some Jewish leaders that he not do so until the shooting victims had been interred and mourned.    Protesters gather Oct. 30 at the intersection of Forbes Road and Murray Avenue in Pittsburgh. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)  Trump traveled from the airport toward Pittsburgh’s predominantly Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood with a small entourage, mostly his immediate family and aides. Of those the White House had invited to join Trump on his tour, many had declined — including the Senate and House Republican majority leaders, their Democratic counterparts, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto and the family of shooting victim Daniel Stein, which was offended by Trump’s suggestion that the synagogue should have had armed security. The protest waiting in Squirrel Hill was rather better attended.    People hold up black papers that they ripped as part of a Jewish custom to represent that lives were ripped apart during the solidarity march Oct. 30 in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. (Justin Merriman for The Washington Post)  “I don’t know what he’s thinking coming to the bluest community of the bluest area of the state,” said Lisa Tamres in the swollen crowd that afternoon. “Why he thought he would be welcome.” Police cars rolled ahead of the throng of marchers and stopped them a block away from the synagogue. On the other side of the police barricade, Trump and his family lit candles and placed stones and flowers on the memorials for the 11 victims. The president did not go into the section of the building that police had found strewn with blood and bullet casings three days earlier.    President Trump and first lady Melania Trump, alongside Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, place stones and flowers on a memorial as they pay their respects at the Tree of Life synagogue. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)  Myers, the Tree of Life rabbi, had declared the previous evening at a vigil for his dead congregants that “words of hate are unwelcome in Pittsburgh.” Many in Pittsburgh shared the rabbi’s sentiment and extended it to mean Trump was unwelcome in their city. The alleged gunman, after all, had echoed the president’s language about migrant “invaders” on social media hours before the massacre — blaming the invasion on Jews. But Myers disagreed with his neighbors on the subject of hospitality. “I welcome him as an American. He is the president,” he told The Washington Post before the visit. “I chose to take the polite and respectful path.” On Tuesday, the rabbi spoke with Trump at some length behind a row of memorials, then shook his hand goodbye. What they said to each other could not be heard by news cameras in the distance, whose microphones recorded only the occasional shouts of the passing protest.    Protesters demonstrate on a main road in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. (Matt Rourke/AP)  The protesters symbolically turned their backs toward the president when they approached the synagogue, and a group of them later sat down in the middle of the street, as if to block the path of his departing motorcade. They sang songs in Hebrew and held up black strips of paper to symbolize lives ripped apart, and chanted.    A man is taken into custody by Pittsburgh police during the protest. (Justin Merriman for The Washington Post)  But it’s likely that Trump was truthful when he tweeted that he never saw the demonstration. Police wouldn’t allow the march to come near the synagogue, and Trump’s motorcade took a different route when it departed for a hospital, where the president visited police officers wounded in the shooting. Of the small, impromptu crowds Trump would have seen along the way, a few even cheered him. The protest turned from the synagogue and marched back to where it started. Of the hundreds of people who participated, there were Jews, Muslims, Christians, activists and families. Whatever Trump saw of it or didn’t, it was not small.

He has rolled out one phantasmagoric idea after another in recent days, some of them as offensive as they are preposterous. There is the tax cut of 10 percent for the middle class that he promised will be “put in” this week by a Congress that is not in session. It was a proposal that no one on Capitol Hill or even his own White House staff had heard about before he blurted it out. There is his declaration that he will rewrite the Constitution by executive order, revoking birthright citizenship, which no one with any serious understanding of the law believes is within his power. He has also done something he can do: ordering 5,200 troops to the border, to deal with the supposed national emergency posed by a caravan of destitute migrants. (By Wednesday afternoon, he had upped the ante to a possible 15,000 troops.) Those asylum seekers are hundreds of miles away and will not arrive for weeks, if they get there at all, given that their numbers are reported to have shrunken by half. On Wednesday morning, the president trumpeted that plan again:   Our military is being mobilized at the Southern Border. Many more troops coming. We will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S. Our Border is sacred, must come in legally. TURN AROUND!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2018    It is not the first time Trump has tried a version of this particular stunt. When Trump sent National Guard troops to the border last spring, something both George W. Bush and Barack Obama had done under similar circumstances, members of the finest military in the world ended up doing things like feeding the Border Patrol’s horses, shoveling manure from their stalls and fixing flat tires. This time, he is taking the unprecedented step of deploying active-duty personnel, in roughly the same numbers as we have serving in Iraq, along with military helicopters and giant spools of razor wire. Trump claims they will be “waiting for” the migrants at the border, implying that U.S. military will be apprehending them as they arrive. But the troops will actually be there in a support role for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, given that the 19th-century Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits the U.S. military from direct participation in law enforcement. In other words, they will be limited to doing what the Guard was already doing. The bottom line is this: Trump is using American troops as props, a gesture both wasteful and disrespectful. We’ve heard often that Trump’s supporters take him seriously, not literally. But as he spews these ridiculous ideas to stir up his base just before an election, it seems reasonable to wonder: How exactly does he regard them? As gullible, or just indifferent to the truth?

88a09f41b1cb340612c25fc3c6b0e824,Americans see voter suppression as a bigger problem than voter fraud,"    A voter arrives as a worker walks past during early voting at a polling place in Charlotte on Oct. 23, 2018. (Chuck Burton/AP)           By  Philip Bump          Philip Bump National correspondent focused largely on the numbers behind politics  Email  Bio  Follow        October 31 at 5:45 PM    There are two competing theories about how American elections fail to accurately capture the sentiment of the electorate. One theory, propagated by President Trump, holds that rampant voter fraud is committed by people unable to vote, swaying elections unfairly. Another theory holds that laws enacted to combat fraud also have the effect of adding new barriers to voting that disproportionately affect demographic groups that, as it happens, tend to vote Democratic. As it turns out, only one of those theories is supported by evidence: There are numerous examples of voter suppression, places where new restrictions on voting curtail turnout, and there is no evidence of rampant voter fraud. But since each position is embraced by one of the two major parties and because this is a polarized time, this is a disputed issue. On Monday, the Pew Research Center released a survey looking at how Americans see these dueling problems. To do so, though, it used an interesting strategy, asking respondents how big fraud or suppression would be depending on how many incidents occurred (in a million-voter election). Overall, voter suppression was considered a major problem by more Americans. In each case, the number of people saying that fraud or suppression were a problem increased as the number of theoretical incidents increased. Put another way: More voter fraud or more voter suppression is seen as a bigger problem.    (Philip Bump/The Washington Post)  But, as expected, views differ by party. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to consider suppression a major problem at every level that it occurs. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to see fraud as a problem.    (Philip Bump/The Washington Post)  What’s particularly interesting, though, is how those views contrast within each party. For example, more Democrats think it’s a major problem if one person is kept from voting than if 10,000 people were to vote illegally! Granted, there’s no evidence that such a thing has ever happened, but that’s not what is being asked. What’s asked is if it did happen, whether it would be a major problem. Four in 10 Democrats say it wouldn’t.    (Philip Bump/The Washington Post)  Views of each problem among Republicans are more even. Generally, though, fraud is more likely to be seen as a major problem than suppression. What’s fascinating about these results is that there are documented examples of thousands of people in an election having their vote suppressed because of laws that make voting more cumbersome. Researchers in Wisconsin estimate that nearly 10,000 Wisconsinites were blocked from voting in 2016 because they lacked proper identification. A study released in 2014 found tens of thousands fewer voters in Kansas and Tennessee in the wake of new voter ID laws. These laws restricting voting are generally imposed by Republican legislators, often while arguing that they’re necessary to combat voter fraud. More than half of Republicans think that even one illegally cast ballot is a major problem; only a little more than a quarter of Democrats agree. But that these laws also have the effect of something that three-quarters of Republicans call a major problem — obstructing hundreds of legal votes — doesn’t seem to prompt objections. (Interestingly, Pew also found a correlation between how supportive respondents were about increasing diversity in the United States and how much they supported making voting as easy as possible.) Pew also asked members of the two major parties whether they viewed the opposition as committed to ensuring fair and accurate elections. About a third of Democrats said Republicans were very or somewhat committed to that goal. About four in 10 Republicans said the same of Democrats.    (Philip Bump/The Washington Post)  How much these views overlap with the parties' positions on fraud and suppression isn’t clear.

3ba86373d672a366e8ca3554c0b1e57d,The Trump administration backs a cease-fire in Yemen. Will it persuade Saudi Arabia?,"      By  Editorial Board     October 31 at 7:54 PM  THE TRUMP administration on Tuesday took a first step toward adjusting U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It issued a call for a cessation of hostilities in Yemen, where the Saudis have been leading a murderous but ineffective military campaign that, with U.S. support, has created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The Saudi intervention was the first of a series of reckless adventures by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that have harmed U.S. interests, culminating in the Oct. 2 slaying of Khashoggi. Yemen is where U.S. action is most urgently needed to contain the damage the crown prince has caused. When the Saudi campaign launched in 2015, Mohammed bin Salman confidently predicted it would quickly rout Houthi rebels who had captured Yemen’s capital and deposed a Saudi-backed government. Three years later, it is nowhere close to that goal — but, according to the United Nations, more than 16,000 civilians have been killed or injured, mostly in airstrikes by the Saudis and their allies that have struck schools, hospitals, food markets, weddings, funerals and, in August, a school bus packed with children. The U.N. chief of humanitarian affairs said last week that half of Yemen’s population — 14 million people out of 28 million — are now on the brink of famine; more than 1 million have been infected by cholera, the largest such outbreak in modern history. Until this week, the Trump administration had offered rhetorical support for a U.N. peace mission while continuing to aid the Saudi air force with refueling and targeting. A U.S.-supplied bomb killed 40 children in that bus. Now, with sentiment in Congress trending toward a cutoff of all U.S. support for the war, the administration has issued parameters for a deescalation. A statement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Houthis should first stop missile and drone attacks against Saudi Arabia, and that “subsequently, [Saudi] air strikes must cease in all populated areas.” Mr. Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said U.N. peace talks should begin by the end of November and focus on confidence-building measures, including the demilitarization of the border and the placing of heavy weapons under international observation. That formula seems tilted in favor of the Saudis, but international officials say there is some reason for it. The Houthis, who refused to attend U.N. talks in September, still control the capital, Sanaa, and the port of Hodeida; they might take a cease-fire as a victory rather than a respite. U.N. officials have been seeking to induce the rebels, who have the backing of Iran, to take steps that show they are serious about making peace — as they have said they are. The Saudis also claim they are open to peace talks. But the regime’s maneuvering on Yemen has been eerily similar to that in the Khashoggi case. Following the bus bombing, Saudi officials first called it an attack on a legitimate target; then said it was an accident; then, as international outrage mounted, labeled it a rogue operation, and promised to investigate and to punish those responsible. If the Trump administration is serious about putting an end to this catastrophic war, it will have to find a way to counter the mendacity as well as the cruelty of Mohammed bin Salman’s regime.

Miller          Michael E. Miller Local enterprise reporter covering immigration, poverty, inequality and crime  Email  Bio  Follow         October 31 at 7:00 AM   SAN PEDRO TAPANATEPEC, Mexico —   The boys had left their neighborhood in Honduras within hours of one another in search of the migrant caravan they had seen on the news. One told his mother he was going to soccer practice. The other sneaked out in the middle of the night.  Somehow, they said, they had found each other in the crowd and followed it here to this small town in southern Mexico. But after more than 600 miles, the two friends were at a crossroads. Despite a throat infection that had turned into a fever, then a cough that rattled his small chest, Isaac Reyes Enamorado was undeterred. “I’ve never thought of turning back,” the 12-year-old said as he rested Sunday in the shade of Tapanatepec’s central plaza.    Isaac Reyes Enamorado, 12, front, who left his family in Honduras to travel with the migrant caravan heading to the U.S.-Mexico border, leaves San Pedro Tapanatepec, Mexico, before dawn on Oct. 29, 2018, to continue the trek north. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)  Two blocks away, Javier Flores Maldonado lay on a dirty yoga mat, thinking just that. A few days earlier, the 16-year-old got word that his mother had fallen ill after learning that he wasn’t playing soccer but was walking to the United States. Now his family wanted him to come home. The caravan has drawn the ire of President Trump, who has alleged without evidence that it includes terrorists and gang members and constitutes a potential “invasion.” There is one prominent feature of the caravan the president has not mentioned: the children. There were roughly 2,300 minors in the 9,300-member caravan when it entered Mexico on Oct. 19, according to UNICEF, although it appears to have shrunk to between 4,000 and 7,000. These children are the most vulnerable of asylum seekers: some as young as a few months, many swaddled in blankets or asleep in strollers whose wheels were coming off after two weeks on the road. Others are traveling alone or with siblings.    Javier Flores Maldonado, 16, front, who left home in Honduras by himself and joined the migrant caravan, waits in San Pedro Tapanatepec to board a bus provided by Mexican authorities to start the journey back home to his ailing mother. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)  Their vulnerability was underlined Saturday night when a man was attacked by fellow migrants after he was accused of trying to abduct a child — an accusation that activists assisting the caravan said was false — and again Monday morning when a child injured his head in a fall from a car on which he was trying to hitch a ride. [Migrant caravan: What you need to know] The danger is heightened for the children traveling without their parents, who — if they continue to the U.S.-Mexico border — will be part of a wave of more than 250,000 unaccompanied minors who have crossed into the United States in the past five years, mostly fleeing gang violence and poverty in Central America. Javier now faced a choice: abandon his dreams of a better life in America or break his mother’s heart. The misery back home    Members of the caravan that set off from Central America aiming to reach the United States are seen in San Pedro Tapanatepec on Oct. 29. Most of the several thousand migrants are on foot, but some hitch rides on passing vehicles. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)  As the caravan rested Sunday in Tapanatepec, the normally sleepy town was transformed into a massive playground. A dozen children clambered atop a single slide. Some kicked crushed water bottles over the cobblestones, while others panhandled in hopes of buying a soccer ball. Everywhere there were small voices screaming and coughing and laughing. Dozens of children were in the river, a murky stream whose brown water provided some relief from the scorching sun. In the middle of the current splashed 17-year-old identical twins Jordy and Jonny Arguijo Gonzalez. They were almost gaunt from walking, and their feet were covered in sores. Their eyes were red from conjunctivitis picked up from dust on the road or from waters like these, which smelled of sewage. They shared a single pair of pink sandals — found on the road — with their father. [Graphic: Navigating the invisible boundary and physical barriers that define the U.S.-Mexico border] On the river bank, among families washing their clothes on the rocks, Denis Arguijo watched over his sons. He had sold fruit from a cart in Tegucigalpa, and when the twins were old enough, he had asked them to help. But then gang members pressed the teens to sell drugs instead, he said. And when the boys refused, the threats began. The caravan was their way to safety. And yet, the teens said they felt like the danger had followed them here to Tapanatepec. Young men smoked marijuana on the river banks. Others openly sold it. One offered “polvo” or powder — cocaine. “There are bad people here, too,” Jordy would say later. “But we stay away from that,” added Jonny. Now their father whistled and the boys, chest high in the water, whistled back to show they were all right. Some children seemed to think of the caravan as an ad­ven­ture, while others viewed it as punishment for something they didn’t realize they had done. Angie Perdomo, 6, said she liked walking every day with her mother. But as Doris Perdomo braided her daughter’s hair, Angie also recounted losing her notebook and crayons as she and her mother fled from tear gas fired by Mexican authorities at the border with Guatemala. “There were police so we had to run away,” Angie said, adding that they didn’t ride in the back of trucks because “you can trip and fall and die.”    Members of the caravan rest on the road in San Pedro Tapanatepec, hoping that vehicles going in their direction — north — will pick up some of them. The caravan includes many unaccompanied children. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)  But the hardships on the road were outweighed by the misery back home. In his hometown of Peña Blanca, Isaac, the 12-year-old who sneaked out in the middle of the night, said he had been one of eight children in a house with plastic tarps for its walls and ceiling. On Oct. 13, his neighbors began heading to San Pedro Sula to join the caravan massing at the bus station. Isaac borrowed 200 Honduran lempiras — about $8 — from his boss, a vegetable vendor. When he told his mother he wanted to join the caravan so he could become an electrician in the United States and build her a proper house in Peña Blanca, she laughed. But then, at 3 in the morning on Oct. 14, he stuffed five shirts and two pairs of pants into his backpack and slipped out the front door. When she realized he’d gone, his mother sent his 19-year-old brother, Fernando, after him. He had found Isaac a week later in Guatemala near the Mexican border. “I’m here to look after him,” Fernando said. “But it’s also a dream of mine to go to the United States.”    Isaac, who started his journey alone and made friends along the way, holds Camila Savioll Mejia, 4, before his group’s predawn departure from San Pedro Tapanatepec. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)  Isaac also found others from his hometown in the caravan, including Javier, the 16-year-old who’d lied to his mother about going to soccer practice. For much of the journey, the two traveled together. Javier had followed his 23-year-old brother, Alex, to the caravan. Alex said he was deported from Mexico nine months ago and saw the caravan as a chance to get back to his pregnant wife in time for the birth. But when Javier found his brother after several days on his own, Alex was angry that Javier — the youngest of seven — had left their mother. Then they called her from Mexico and heard about her heart problems. “This has been hard for him,” Alex said. “He’s been depressed.” In recent days, as the decision whether to go back weighed on Javier, he and Isaac had drifted apart. While Isaac was eager to jump on whatever truck slowed for them, Javier was not. It was as if something was pulling him back to Honduras. By Sunday night, it was time to decide. He borrowed his brother’s phone and dialed his mother. One boy's decision    Isaac, front left, and some of his new friends sing to Johana Hernandez, right, on her 16th birthday, Oct. 29. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)  On Monday, Isaac awoke at 2 a.m. inside a hedged garden in the plaza, roused by the sound of activists on loudspeakers. An hour later, the caravan was on the move, streaming out of Tapanatepec on its way to another town 30 miles away. “Vámonos,” Isaac urged the stragglers, still sleeping on the sidewalk. “Let’s go.” When the caravan passed an outdoor gym on the way out of town, Isaac leaped onto the equipment, doing situps with a smile. Two hours later, after several miles and a nap in a ditch, Isaac spotted an empty truck and jumped onto the back with two dozen other men and boys, disappearing into the distance just as dawn broke. Back in Tapanatepec, Javier waited at the police station. He was No. 35 on a list of 80 migrants who had asked for “voluntary departure.” For four hours he waited, bored and yet anxious to see his mother. When a bus arrived, Javier sprang to his feet. An official handed him a packet of “oral electrolytes” and a pamphlet warning migrants that they could be attacked by cartels or abandoned by smugglers. But Javier had already made up his mind. Once he had saved enough money, he was going to try again to make it to the United States — this time using a smuggler. “That way my mother will know that I’m safe,” he said. Then he boarded the bus back home.    Javier, whose trek will take him no farther north than San Pedro Tapanatepec, walks to the bus on which he will begin his voluntary departure from Mexico. He is returning home to Honduras. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)   Julia Galiano contributed to this report.

82079cde2621b926006f72944bb82bf0,"North Korean women face widespread sexual violence by ‘government officials,’ rights group says","      By Min Joo Kim     October 31 at 10:01 PM   SEOUL — North Korean officials commit sexual violence against women with apparent impunity as part of systemic oppression and other abuses tolerated within Kim Jong Un’s regime, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Wednesday.  The 86-page report offers the latest glimpse into a range of suspected human rights violations carried out by authorities in the North Korean state, including public executions and arbitrary detentions of suspected activists and dissidents. The findings come amid a flurry of diplomacy on North Korea led by the United States and South Korea. Washington and Seoul have carefully avoided confronting Kim head-on over rights issues, opting instead for more-general talks in hopes of persuading Kim to dismantle the North’s nuclear program. Tomas Ojea Quintana, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, said at a news conference last week that he was “very concerned” about the absence of a human rights agenda in key statements after Kim’s separate summit meetings with President Jae-in Moon of South Korea and President Trump. Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch’s executive director, said that “North Korean women should not have to risk being raped by government officials or workers when they leave their homes to earn money to feed their families.” [North Korean women have reason to say #MeToo but no hope of reckoning] “Kim Jong Un and his government should acknowledge the problem and take urgent steps to protect women and ensure justice for survivors of sexual violence,” Roth added. The regime in Pyongyang said that North Korea is a “heaven for women” in response to a call for action from the United Nations in 2014 on human rights abuses. But testimonies by more than 50 female defectors from North Korea in the report describe a lack of judicial avenues to report sexual violence and a culture that places a social stigma on rape victims who come forward. The report does not directly link the abuses to the highest ranks of Kim’s regime, but it suggests there are few controls on officials such as police officers and prison-camp guards to prevent assaults against women. “When an official in a position of power ‘picks’ a woman she has no choice but to comply with any demands he makes, whether for sex, money, or other favors,” the report said. A former market merchant who left North Korea in 2013 was quoted as saying that she could not report being raped, because “it is like spitting in your own face,” given the victim-blaming culture and apparent impunity allowed to men in positions of power. Fewer than 10 perpetrators have been convicted of rape in North Korea in recent years, according to data submitted to a U.N. committee by the Pyongyang government in July 2017. Most of the women who testified to Human Rights Watch had been in the custody of authorities or were merchants subject to sexual abuse by officials as they traveled across the border or within the country. [North Korea defector paid smugglers to get family out. China sent them back.] Yoon Mi Hwa, a former trader from North Hamgyong province who escaped North Korea in 2014, described to Human Rights Watch how a guard at a holding center in 2009 would pick a woman to be raped each night. Like all the women cited in the report, Yoon is referred to by a pseudonym to protect her identity and any relatives in North Korea. “Click, click, click was the most horrible sound I ever heard,” Yoon was quoted as saying in the report. “It was the sound of the key of the cell of our prison room opening. Every night a prison guard would open the cell. I stood still quietly, acting like I didn’t notice, hoping it wouldn’t be me the one to have to follow the guard.” One defector not cited in the report, Seo Hyang-ran, said she was stripped and vaginally searched by secret-police officials after being returned from China in a failed attempt to seek haven in the region. She told The Washington Post she was “picked” as a rape target by a guard at a detention facility in North Hamgyong. “I couldn’t make sense of what happened to me, but it felt extremely humiliating,” said Seo, who now works as a counselor for North Korean defectors at Chungnam National University Hospital in South Korea. “Now I know that it wasn’t my fault and I was unfairly subjected to sexual violence.” Read more: Opinion: Trump era is full of cruelty without consequence Satellite images show North Korea’s ‘reeducation’ camps Korean defectors wonder: Could they really go home again?

909ef5d7efcfcb91445cbaba0fbc9e58,Early vote totals in at least 17 states already surpass 2014 turnout at this point,"      By  Amy Gardner          Amy Gardner National political reporter  Email  Bio  Follow         October 31 at 7:54 PM  Americans have already voted in record numbers in many states in this year’s midterm elections, confirming the heightened interest in the fight for control of Congress and state houses playing out in dozens of bitterly contested races. With less than a week remaining until Election Day, voters in at least 17 states surpassed overall early and absentee voting numbers from 2014, according to Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida. In some cases, early and absentee vote totals are on track to double since four years ago. The numbers are so high in some states that early voting may exceed total vote counts — including Election Day tallies — from four years ago. The heightened participation reflects in part a surge of interest among Democrats, who stayed home in large numbers in 2014, when Republicans took control of the Senate and widened their control of the House. But data from several battleground states with marquee Senate or governor’s races show Republicans are also very engaged — as much as they were four years ago — suggesting many hard-fought races could be even closer than surveys are predicting. “We can’t know who people are voting for, but we can see who is showing up to vote,” said McDonald, who compiles a clearinghouse of voting data called the Elections Project . “What we’re seeing is very high levels of engagement on both sides in the competitive elections for governor and Senate.”    Early ballots wait in bins to be sorted in the Denver Elections Division headquarters. (David Zalubowski/AP)  Some of the boost in participation can be attributed to what McDonald calls the cannibalism effect: the fact that more and more voters are choosing to vote early or by mail-in ballot, with more states offering easier ways to do so. That raises uncertainty about whether the surge in voting will last through Election Day. But the numbers are already so high in some states that experts have grown increasingly confident overall turnout will be up this year. Turnout in 2014, at 37 percent of eligible voters nationwide, was the lowest for a midterm election since World War II. In the 2016 presidential election, turnout was about 61 percent, roughly the same as 2012. Two states that show a boost in voter participation so far this year are Florida and Nevada, which both feature competitive races for Senate and governor. In Nevada, a total of about 308,000 voters cast early, absentee or mail-in ballots in 2014, according to state data. As of early Wednesday, with three more days of in-person early voting to go, the figure for this year was at 463,016. The numbers showed a marginal advantage for Democratic voters, who have cast roughly 192,000 votes compared with 180,000 Republicans and 90,000 with no party affiliation. Those figures could mean an exceedingly close race for Senate, in which Sen. Dean Heller (R) is defending his seat against Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, and for governor, in which Republican Attorney General Adam Laxalt and Democrat Steve Sisolak, the chairman of the Clark County Commission, are competing. In Florida, 3.4 million voters have cast ballots early or by mail, compared with a total of 3.2 million in 2014, according to state data. Voters have until Saturday to vote early in person and have until Tuesday to return their ballots. As of early Wednesday, Republican mail-in ballots outnumbered Democratic ones, 820,000 to 755,000. The partisan breakdown of those who have voted early in person is roughly evenly split — a fact that should concern Democrats, McDonald said. Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, faces Republican Ron DeSantis, a former congressman, in the governor’s race, while Sen. Bill Nelson (D) faces a challenge from Republican Rick Scott, the outgoing governor. “The early vote is slightly favoring the Republicans,” McDonald said. “You see this persistent lead for Gillum and Nelson in the polls, but it looks like it’s going to be a close election.” McDonald noted that turnout appears to be favoring Democrats more in states without a marquee Senate race, including Iowa, North Carolina and Maryland. The absence of a competitive statewide race with heavy advertising in those states could be giving Democrats an advantage because of national factors, such as President Trump’s unpopularity, he said. The states other than Florida and Nevada that had surpassed 2014 early-voting participation as of early Wednesday were Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and West Virginia.

39e56f895a74a36cd1d0df79a6477cd7,"‘Saviors of the white race’: Perpetrators of hate crimes see themselves as heroes, researchers say","      By  Terrence McCoy          Terrence McCoy Reporter covering social issues  Email  Bio  Follow         October 31 at 8:15 PM  In Kansas, a middle-aged man yells, “Get out of my country!” and shoots dead an Indian-born immigrant. In New York, another man, convinced the white race is being destroyed by interracial marriage, allegedly finds an African American homeless man and stabs him to death. And on Saturday, in Pittsburgh, police say a man entered a synagogue with an AR-15 rifle, murdered 11 people, then explained his actions to a SWAT officer this way: “They’re committing genocide to my people. I just want to kill Jews.” These killings, the fear, and the men radicalized by it: They all reflect what some experts describe as the ­evolution of the hate crime in the United States. Over the past several decades, academic researchers have charted how hate crimes, which have been rising overall, have increasingly gone from sadistic quests to inflict pain on members of minority groups to violence used as an angry defense against rapid ­social and demographic changes. The perpetrators of this share of hate crimes are largely white men who hold the belief, exacerbated by rhetoric in politics and media, that they are protecting their culture, race and an endangered way of life that has historically — and, in their view, rightly — placed them at the top. Some belong to white-supremacist groups, but many don’t. In their version of the story, these men are not the villains, but the heroes, according to those who study them. “White-supremacist ideology begins with this acceptance that there is this existential threat against the white race, and this gives people license to rationalize doing anything if it will protect or save the white race,” said Mark Pitcavage, an analyst at the Anti-Defamation League. “And this is one of the factors that leads to a lot of violence.”     [Pittsburgh shooting comes amid rise in hate crimes] There are four commonly cited types of hate crimes, conceived by Northeastern University researchers in 2002 and now used by the National Institute of Justice and taught at the FBI Academy. One type is thrill-seeking — the perpetrators, often young white men, seek excitement and to show dominance by terrorizing members of minority groups they consider inferior. There are retaliatory hate crimes, to pay back a group for some alleged transgression. A third type consists of mission hate crimes, which are carried out by people so devoted to hatred that it becomes a career. The rest fall into the “defensive” category. They are committed by people who believe they are protecting themselves or their territory from perceived outsiders. Perpetrators’ motives can sometimes be mixed. To create the typology, the Northeastern researchers first analyzed 169 hate crimes that had been reported to Boston police in 1991 and 1992. A later study, published in 2002, found that one-fourth of the crimes were defensive and two-thirds were thrill-seeking in type. “It was typically a group of young people who would go out together on a Saturday night, looking for someone to bash” as a way to exert power but also to look cool to friends, study co-author Jack Levin said. “They would look for gays or Muslims or blacks or people with disabilities,” and if they didn’t find their target, they would just go on to the next minority group. “Hatemongers don’t specialize,” said Levin, co-director of Northeastern University’s Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict. The hate crimes at that point were sadistic, but often less extreme, he said. Fewer people ended up dead. In recent decades, however, a collision of social forces appears to have reshuffled the balance of hate crimes in America, according to research by Levin and others. The shift began after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which “changed everything,” Levin said. The prevalence of defensive hate attacks connected to threatening events began to increase, Levin noted in a 2015 study he co-authored with Ashley Reichelmann, a professor at Virginia Tech, that was published in American Behavioral Scientist. Using FBI data in that study, the authors found that the number of crimes targeting Muslims and Arabs quickly skyrocketed, from 28 hate crimes in 2000 to 481 in 2001. The same happened when Massachusetts became the first state in 2004 to allow gay marriage, the study said, showing the number of hate-motivated assaults against gay people rising from two in 2002 to 24 in 2004. The phenomenon repeated itself with crimes against Latinos, the study found. In 2002, only 1 percent of hate-motivated assault victims were Latino. But by 2010, when unemployment from the Great Recession was at its height and immigration was reconfiguring communities all over the United States, they accounted for 40 percent of victims of hate-motivated assaults. Levin hasn’t reproduced his original study showing the overall composition of hate crimes, so it’s difficult to say for sure how much the defensive category has grown in percentage. But other experts and additional research support the idea that this kind of hate crime has surged. James Nolan, an expert on hate crime at West Virginia University, has also studied how the nature of hate crimes and their perpetrators changed after 9/11. Afterward, he found hate crimes were less likely to be perpetrated by young thrill-seekers than by people older than 40 who were defensive and reactive to perceived social threats. The study, which is about to be peer reviewed for publication in American Behavioral Scientist, also found a correlation between political rhetoric during the 2016 presidential campaign targeting minority groups and a subsequent spike in hate crimes against them. “From the FBI hate crime data we can see how the conditions for defensive hate crimes are created by significant events and the discourse surrounding them,” Nolan said. Brian Levin, a professor and director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino, has reported similar spikes after threatening events, including 9/11, passage of the same-sex marriage law, the election of President Barack Obama and the surge in the unemployment rate. He tallied 1,037 hate crimes in 2016, an increase of more than 23 percent over the previous year in the nine areas he researched. Other experts say defensiveness fueled by racial anxiety or social changes perceived as threatening has always been a key motivator for hate crime, regardless of the era. “The root of hate crime has not changed,” said Carolyn Petrosino, a professor at Bridgewater State University, who has written extensively on the issue. “The urgency of maintaining control has.” The factors researchers cite behind recent hate crimes are many: The manufacturing industry collapsed, and economic inequality widened, making life more financially precarious for many white men. Then when they turn on the television, the faces they see are no longer as white as they once were. The United States, meanwhile, elected its first black president. And underlying it all has been the deep anxiety that some whites feel over the prospect of losing their majority status, scheduled to happen sometime around 2045. “Cumulatively, these threats operate together to create tremendous anger in some Americans who might otherwise be more tolerant toward people who are different,” Jack Levin said. “Now, they’re looking for someone to blame.” The FBI recorded 6,121 hate crimes in 2016, which the agency defines as criminal incidents motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation or gender, more than at any time since 2012. Race or ethnicity is the motivating factor in most hate crimes, but among attacks on the basis of religion, anti-Semitism was most prevalent. The FBI declined to comment about the underlying causes of hate crimes.

In the Jim Crow era, when the Ku Klux Klan was at its height, white supremacy was rooted in maintaining overt dominance and resisting the proposals of civil rights activists. But with that battle long over, and with white supremacists cast as history’s losers, their pitch has changed. Today, white supremacy is increasingly centered on the perceived victimhood of whites, left defenseless in a multicultural world of widespread immigration, affirmative action and interracial marriage. “Dylann Roof thought he was saving the world,” said Heidi Beirich, a project director at the Southern Poverty Law Center. “They’ve come to believe they’re saviors of the white race. . . . I’m doing this to protect my race.” Then add the accelerant of political demagoguery exploiting fear and division, amplified by social media communities. “When I hear the word ‘caravan’ I reach for my gun!” one person wrote on Monday on 4chan, where conspiracy theorists and members of the far-right congregate, when another user shared a picture of a tweet in which President Trump called the migrant caravan headed to the Mexican border an “invasion” rife with “Gang Members.” “RIP humanity,” another user worried. “The rhetoric coming out of the White House is giving people license to target these people,” said Daryl Johnson, former senior analyst for domestic terrorism at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, who left the agency in 2010. There was a time when it was more lonely being an extremist, when similar-minded people were accessible only through newsletters or in-person meetings. Now, all it takes is a computer and an Internet connection to access an online chat room, where the narrative is always easy to understand — it’s all their fault. The communities not only provide an addicting sense of righteousness and superiority, but also an inflated sense of numbers. [A conspiracy theory about George Soros and a migrant caravan inspired horror] “The feeling is that you’re part of a large like-minded cause,” Pitcavage said. “It’s not just a bubble, but an echo chamber, where people are constantly exposed to views — and not moderating views, but views that are just as extreme, if not more extreme, than their own.” But what makes an extremist a murderer? What tips them into violence? These are questions that researchers still haven’t been able to answer. “We have no idea what shifts someone from ideology to violence,” Beirich said. “There is no way to know what is the moment of breaking.” Not all extremists are perpetrators of violent hatred. But most perpetrators, she said, are extremists. That’s why on Saturday, when news of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting was first washing across the Internet, she didn’t have to wait for the details to know who the alleged killer was. “Within three minutes of the CNN story being posted, the first thing that came to mind was member of the radical right, raging anti-Semite, and I bet he’s active online. It’s just the case with so many of these people lately.” Hours later came the first stories of suspect Robert Bowers’s prolific online history, which included rants against Jews, refugees and African Americans. “We can not let the . . . get any kind of foothold here,” he wrote in one post weeks before the shooting, using an anti-Semitic word. And in apparent reference to the Holocaust, recalling Trump’s campaign slogan, he wrote in another: “Make ovens 1488 F again.” ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/saviors-of-the-white-race-perpetrators-of-hate-crimes-see-themselves-as-heroes-researchers-say/2018/10/31/277a2bdc-daeb-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html,washingtonpost,www.washingtonpost.com,1746,15
3756f0922c1d46af4d2b2bf72550a7c7,Report: Taliban maintaining foothold in Afghanistan amid increasing violence,"      By  Pamela Constable          Pamela Constable Foreign correspondent covering Afghanistan, Pakistan, South Asia, Latin America and immigration  Email  Bio  Follow         November 1 at 12:01 AM   KABUL — A new report by a U.S. government watchdog paints a discouraging portrait of Afghanistan in recent months, detailing continued Taliban gains, record civilian casualties by pro-government airstrikes and insurgent attacks, a disappointing performance by U.S.-funded ­anti-corruption agencies, and soaring drug production and addiction.  In a tense political season, when hopes for change have inspired millions of Afghans to vote for a new parliament and hopes for peace have spurred new efforts at dialogue with Taliban insurgents, the report released Thursday by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR) casts a sobering eye on persistent setbacks in the fight against the Taliban and cumulative failures in the wars on corruption and drugs.  The report stressed that Taliban control and influence continued to expand nationwide in recent months, while Afghan government control or influence over national territory has “reached the lowest level” since late 2015, declining slightly to 55 percent of 407 districts. It said government forces “made minimal or no progress in pressuring the Taliban” in the past three months, and also “failed to gain greater control or influence over districts, population and territory.” The report also highlighted the sustained high rate of war-related deaths and injuries among both civilians and security forces: 2,798 civilians were killed and 5,252 injured between May and September, a record high. It also said the average monthly number of casualties among Afghan military and police forces, while not officially released, was “the greatest it has ever been” in similar periods of time during the conflict, probably between 30 to 40 killed per day. The report found that during the first nine months of 2018, there was a dramatic increase in suicide attacks by insurgents, which rose by 38 percent over the same period last year, and in casualties caused by airstrikes by Afghan and coalition forces, which rose by 46 percent to 313 deaths and 336 injuries. The report noted that U.S. and coalition officials have disputed the latter set of figures, reporting that far fewer civilians were killed or injured.  The SIGAR report also described a number of “discouraging developments” in the past several months, including the four-day Taliban siege of Ghazni city in August and the insurgents’ rejection of a second truce offered by President Ashraf Ghani the same month. Also on that list was the Oct. 18 shooting attack in Kandahar at a meeting of U.S. and regional officials that killed the regional police and intelligence chiefs. The top U.S. military commander in the country, Gen. Scott Miller, escaped unharmed in the attack, which the Taliban took credit for carrying out. In an especially critical look at U.S.-funded efforts to combat narcotics, the report described a rapidly escalating problem of opium production and drug addiction that has defied years of expensive programs and investment.  “These efforts have cost U.S. taxpayers more than $8 billion since 2002, yet Afghanistan’s opium crisis is worse than ever,” John F. Sopko, the special inspector general, wrote in an introduction to the 250-page document.  The report said that Afghan opium poppy cultivation has reached an “unprecedented high” of about 820,000 acres, and that opium accounts for 19 to 32 percent of the country’s gross domestic product and provides half a million jobs, representing “a backbone” of the Afghan economy.  It also noted that addiction to opioids among Afghans has skyrocketed, reaching several million people. Overall, it said, the drug trade has become “an existential threat to the Afghan state” by fueling corruption and crime, and by financially benefiting the insurgency.  Despite these alarming developments and the large sums spent by U.S. agencies to combat drugs in Afghanistan since 2002, the report found that U.S. officials have played down the narcotics problem in recent years and no longer see it as a “mission objective or a priority.” The inspector general called for a “deep review” of U.S. anti-drug policies and efforts in the country. A more surprising aspect of the SIGAR report was its sharp criticism of the Afghan attorney general’s office and its highly touted foreign-funded initiatives to combat corruption and crime in Afghan civilian government and military sectors. The report blasted the attorney general, a respected former human rights advocate, for having a “poor record of prosecuting powerful and influential corrupt actors” and failing to cooperate with U.S. officials.  The report cited criticisms by the U.S. Department of Justice that the Afghan attorney general’s office is “unproductive, corrupt and patronage-laden.”  Read more In Afghanistan’s Kandahar province, parliamentary vote delayed but peaceful U.S. military scales back contact with Afghans after ‘insider’ shootings The Taliban has vowed to disrupt Afghan elections.
